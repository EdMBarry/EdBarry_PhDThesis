\textbf{Paragraph 1: Overall goal of modelling processes}





\textbf{Paragraph 2: Overarching goal of the thesis}
This work was done in order to present a modelling framework for the growth of purple phototrophic bacteria. The goal of the framework was to describe the behaviours of PPB in domestic or medium strength wastewaters when subject to substrate limitations, including limitations due to insufficient irradiance. From this mathematical framework, it is expected that model validation and calibration will lead to an industrial tool for process understanding, design and optimisation.
