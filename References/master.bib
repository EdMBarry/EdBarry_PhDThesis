	abstract = {Microalgae are produced today for human and animal markets, as food-feed and source of active compounds. Microalgae can be also used inwastewater treatment and they has been proposed as biofuels source to reduce global warming problem.Whatever the final application ofmicroalgae its production is based on the same principles as light availability, enough mass and heat transfer and adequate control of culture parameters. In this paper these principals are revised.Moreover, the production must be carried out at adequate scale using photobioreactors. Design of photobioreactor is deter- mined by the final use of biomass and quality required. Different designs today used are revised, including last designs proposed, identifying his characteristics param- eters and applications. In addition, the obligation of adequate control strategies is discussed. Finally, the bottlenecks for the scale-upof the different technologies and thus ofmicroalgae production are summarized.},

abstract = {Recently it has been demonstrated that algal biomass yield can be enhanced using fluid flow patterns known as Taylor vortices. It has been suggested that these growth rate improvements can be attributed to improved light delivery as a result of rapid transport of microorganisms between light and dark regions of the reactor. However, Taylor vortices also strongly impact fluid mixing and interphase (gas-liquid) mass transport, and these in turn may also explain improvements in biomass productivity. To identify the growth-limiting factor in a Taylor vortex algal photobioreactor, experiments were performed to determine characteristic time scales for mixing and mass transfer. By comparing these results with the characteristic time scale for biomass growth, it is shown that algal growth rate in Taylor vortex reactors is not limited by fluid mixing or interphase mass transfer, and therefore the observed biomass productivity improvements are likely attributable to improved light utilization efficiency.},

abstract = {The performance of the open source multiphase flow solver, interFoam, is evaluated in this work. The solver is based on a modified volume of fluid (VoF) approach, which incorporates an interfacial compression flux term to mitigate the effects of numerical smearing of the interface. It forms a part of the C + + libraries and utilities of OpenFOAM and is gaining popularity in the multiphase flow research community. However, to the best of our knowledge, the evaluation of this solver is confined to the validation tests of specific interest to the users of the code and the extent of its applicability to a wide range of multiphase flow situations remains to be explored. In this work, we have performed a thorough investigation of the solver performance using a variety of verification and validation test cases, which include (i) verification tests for pure advection (kinematics), (ii) dynamics in the high Weber number limit and (iii) dynamics of surface tension-dominated flows. With respect to (i), the kinematics tests show that the performance of interFoam is generally comparable with the recent algebraic VoF algorithms; however, it is noticeably worse than the geometric reconstruction schemes. For (ii), the simulations of inertia-dominated flows with large density ratios  yielded excellent agreement with analytical and experimental results. In regime (iii), where surface tension is important, consistency of pressure–surface tension formulation and accuracy of curvature are important, as established by Francois et al (2006 J. Comput.

Several verification tests were performed along these lines and the main findings are: (a) the algorithm of interFoam ensures a consistent formulation of pressure and surface tension; (b) the curvatures computed by the solver converge to a value slightly (10{\%}) different from the analytical value and a scope for improvement exists in this respect. To reduce the disruptive effects of spurious currents, we followed the analysis of Galusinski and Vigneaux (2008 J. Comput.

@article{Pareek2008a,
abstract = {In this paper, we have discussed the state of the art on numerical techniques for estimating light intensity distribution in photocatalytic reactors. After giving a brief introduction to various photocatalytic reactor designs, a detailed derivation of the radiation transport equation (RTE) has been presented. The RTE is an integrodifferential equation and needs appropriate boundary conditions and optical properties of the medium. To provide a boundary condition for the light emitted from the radiation sources, a number of lamp source models have been described. Different approaches for the numerical simulation of the RTE have been presented with special emphasis on the Monte Carlo and finite volume (or discrete ordinate) approaches. In the Monte Carlo approach, the reaction space was divided into small cubical cells. The path of a photon was traced using a stochastic approach. A conservative variant of the discrete ordinate model available in FLUENT was used to assess the effect of wall reflectivity, catalyst loading, and phase function parameter on the light intensity distribution. For relatively low catalyst loadings, the wall reflectivity strongly influenced the light intensity distribution. However, for an optically thick medium, the wall reflectivity had very little or no effect. The volume-averaged light intensity distribution decreased rather sharply with the catalyst loading and an opposite trend was obtained for LVREA. Finally, a semiempirical kinetic model was presented to evaluate the rate of reaction and conversion of a photoreactor using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. Model verification was carried out using experimental data for photodegradation of Bayer liquor. A correlation coefficient of 0.974 between simulated and experimental results indicated that the proposed model was adequate. {\textcopyright} 2008 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.

@article{Wagner2016,
abstract = {Cultivation of microalgae in open ponds and closed photobioreactors (PBRs) using wastewater resources offers an opportunity for biochemical nutrient recovery. Effective reactor system design and process control of PBRs requires process models. Several models with different complexities have been developed to predict microalgal growth. However, none of these models can effectively describe all the relevant processes when microalgal growth is coupled with nutrient removal and recovery from wastewaters. Here, we present a mathematical model developed to simulate green microalgal growth (ASM-A) using the systematic approach of the activated sludge modelling (ASM) framework. The process model – identified based on a literature review and using new experimental data – accounts for factors influencing photoautotrophic and heterotrophic microalgal growth, nutrient uptake and storage (i.e. Droop model) and decay of microalgae. Model parameters were estimated using laboratory-scale batch and sequenced batch experiments using the novel Latin Hypercube Sampling based Simplex (LHSS) method. The model was evaluated using independent data obtained in a 24-L PBR operated in sequenced batch mode. Identifiability of the model was assessed. The model can effectively describe microalgal biomass growth, ammonia and phosphate concentrations as well as the phosphorus storage using a set of average parameter values estimated with the experimental data. A statistical analysis of simulation and measured data suggests that culture history and substrate availability can introduce significant variability on parameter values for predicting the reaction rates for bulk nitrate and the intracellularly stored nitrogen state-variables, thereby requiring scenario specific model calibration. ASM-A was identified using standard cultivation medium and it can provide a platform for extensions accounting for factors influencing algal growth and nutrient storage using wastewater resources.},

abstract = {The present work addresses energy consumption in raceway ponds (RWPs). This kind of systems are today the most utilized industrial plant for outdoor algae cultivation. The problem has been addressed combining theoretical correlations and experimental data. Head losses for conventional raceway ponds were evaluated, and the results were compared with data available in literature. Computational fluid dynamics was used to support the theoretical analysis. This study suggested possible improvements to the traditional RWP design: an Innovative Raceway Pond (IRP II) was therefore designed, built and operated in parallel with a reference pilot RWP in a test site. Several modifications to traditional RWP design were implemented in the IRP II: the paddle wheel was substituted by a propeller, the water head was reduced and baffle boards were installed in the curves. To validate the new design, head losses and therefore energy consumption in the different systems were evaluated, during cultivation experiments, with two microalgae strains. The theoretical and experimental study allowed a validated calculation, which showed the importance of concentrated head losses towards distributed ones. The analysis highlighted how these losses weight at different pond scales, suggesting possible improvements of the RWP energy performance - as achieved in the IRP II - through revised design for optimized mixing. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional dynamic Eulerian-Eulerian two-phase model is used for the modelling of bubble column hydrodynamics in the homogeneous flow regime. The turbulence in liquid phase is considered by the standard k-$\epsilon$ model. Further numerical studies investigate the influence of additional turbulence production through the dispersed gas phase. The dispersed phase is represented by a mono-dispersal neglecting coalescence and break-up effects. Detailed experiments performed in a cylindrical bubble column allow for the validation of the model. The measurements focus on the local liquid-phase velocities and gas void fractions. The numerical simulations successfully predict both the time-averaged and the dynamic flow behaviour. The measured low-frequency velocity fluctuations are used for the validation of the simulated large-scale flow dynamics that is dominated by the irregular movements of the bubble plume and the vortical structures in the liquid phase. The consideration of bubble-induced turbulence shows positive as well as negative impacts on the quality of the simulation results for a coarse numerical grid. Due to the mutual influences, the turbulence model has to be discussed together with the grid resolution. Employing finer grids improves the description of the vortical flow structure in the bubble column and the agreement with the experimental data. However, the computation power increases significantly and a compromise between efficiency and quality of results has to be found. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Experiments in tabular reactor were designed to measure the rates of these process during the early stages of biofilm accumulation as a function of the Reynolds number and suspended biomass concentration. Results indicate deposition (i.e., combined transport and adsorption) is only important in the very early stages of biofilm accumulation and is significantly influenced by negligible for the thin biofilms encountered in these experiments. Net biofilm production rates in all experiments decrease to same level and this level is not affected by changes in Reynolds number or suspended biomass concentration.

abstract = {Inhibition of electron transport and damage to the protein subunits by visible light has been studied in isolated reaction centers of the non-sulfur purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Illumination by 1100 muEm(-2) s(-1) light induced only a slight effect in wild type, carotenoid containing 2.4.1. reaction centers. In contrast, illumination of reaction centers isolated from the carotenoidless R26 strain resulted in the inhibition of charge separation as detected by the loss of the initial amplitude of absorbance change at 430 nm arising from the P(+)Q(B) (-) --{\textgreater} PQ(B) recombination. In addition to this effect, the L, M and H protein subunits of the R26 reaction center were damaged as shown by their loss on Coomassie stained gels, which was however not accompanied by specific degradation products. Both the loss of photochemical activity and of protein subunits were suppressed in the absence of oxygen. By applying EPR spin trapping with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine we could detect light-induced generation of singlet oxygen in the R26, but not in the 2.4.1. reaction centers. Moreover, artificial generation of singlet oxygen, also led to the loss of the L, M and H subunits. Our results provide evidence for the common hypothesis that strong illumination by visible light damages the carotenoidless reaction center via formation of singlet oxygen. This mechanism most likely proceeds through the interaction of the triplet state of reaction center chlorophyll with the ground state triplet oxygen in a similar way as occurs in Photosystem II.},

abstract = {A study is performed of the effect of turbulent mixing on algae growth rate under light-limiting conditions. In order to isolate the effect of light fluctuations and to eliminate possible effects of mass transfer and other side effects of mixing, a numerical model of algae growth is employed. The study examines three aspects of turbulent mixing using models of increasing complexity. First, mixing increases the depth of the “mixed layer”—the layer of approximately uniform algae concentration—spreading the algae produced near the surface over a thicker fluid region. We demonstrate that mixed layer depth has no effect on the net algae production rate. Second, mixing causes motion of algae cells across the optical gradient. A single-frequency harmonic model is used to demonstrate the influence of periodic motion on algae production rate for different frequencies and concentration values. The model results explain previous apparently contradictory experimental observations. Significant enhancement of algae production rate with mixing is observed for small values of the ratio of illuminated layer depth to total fluid depth; however, growth rate enhancement saturates beyond a certain mixing frequency. Third, turbulent mixing involves a broad range of fluid time and length scales. A direct numerical simulation of homogeneous turbulence coupled to the algae growth model is used to show that the main conclusions of the single-frequency model can be carried over to a more realistic turbulent flow by appropriate choice of the mixing time scale.},

Leading consultants, equipment manufacturers, and WWTP modelling software developers have made meaningful contributions to advancing the use of biofilm models in engineering practice, but the bulk of the engineering community either does not use the now readily available biofilm reactor modules or utilizes them as 'black-box' design tools. The latter approach results in the mathematical biofilm models being no more useful than the empirical design criteria and formulations that have been historically applied to biofilm reactor design.

The calculations were carried out using the discrete ordinates method, but the analysis is equally valid for the finite-volume method. It is shown that the S schemes of the genuinely multidimensional family perform quite well, particularly in problems with discontinuous radiation intensity fields. However, they are time consuming, and so they do not always become more attractive regarding the trade-off between accuracy and computational requirements, in comparison with other high-order schemes that, although being less accurate, are also more economical. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A new experimental approach was thus proposed to identify those physical parameters impacting biofilm development in such conditions.

The flow pattern therein was characterized using two computational fluid dynamic calculation approaches. Full trials were run for 48 h at 10 °C with a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain to identify the preferential biofilm formation areas. As in current industrial systems, the pilot rig had recirculation areas and low wall shear stress rates ($\tau$w {\textless} 0.1 Pa) in corners and angles. These were identified as critical areas with Surface Microbial Loads (SML) over 5 Log10/cm2. However, $\tau$w alone failed to explain why SML in areas under unidirectional flow was higher than in the mock-ups. Lastly, air/liquid/wall interface conditions were more critical than immersed surfaces. This study validated the possibility of using CFD methods to understand the way in which flow pattern influences biofilm formation. The methodology proposed would be helpful in quantifying equipment components criticality based on biofilm growth parameters.},

abstract = {The fundamentals of a new radiation model are described in this paper. The spatial and angular dependence of the radiation intensity are split in such a way that the radiation intensity is approximated by a linear combination of basis functions dependent only on the angular direction. The coefficients of the approximation are functions of the spatial coordinates. The spatial discretization is performed using the finite volume method and the angular discretization is based on the finite element method. This means that the basis functions are defined according to the criteria used in the finite element method. The step scheme was employed in the spatial discretization and bilinear basis functions were chosen for the angular discretization. The method may be applied to both grey and non-grey media, non-scattering and scattering media, simple and complex geometries. However, it is still in an early stage of development, and therefore it is applied in this paper to simple one-dimensional problems of radiative transfer in enclosures with grey, emitting-absorbing and scattering media. The results obtained show that the method gives good results for several benchmark problems with available analytical solutions, and converges to the exact solution as the grid is refined and the number of terms in the approximation increases. ?? 2005 Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {It is well-known that the response of photosynthetic microorganisms in photobioreactor (PBR) is greatly influenced by the geometry of the process, and its cultivation parameters. The design of an adapted PBR requires understanding of the coupling between the biological response and the environmental conditions applied. Cells culture under well-defined conditions are thus of primary interest. A particular lab-scale PBR has been developed for this purpose. It is based on a torus shape, that enables light to be highly controlled while providing a very efficient mixing, especially along the light gradient in the culture, that it is known to be a key-parameter in PBR running. A complete characterization of hydrodynamic conditions is presented, using computational fluids dynamics (CFD). After validation by comparison with experimental measurements, a parametric study is conducted to characterize important hydrodynamics features with respect to PBR application (light access, circulation velocity, global shear-stress), and then to investigate a possible optimization of the process via modification of the impeller used for culture mixing. The final part of the study is devoted to a detailed investigation of mixing performance of the torus PBR, by numerically predicting dispersion of a passive tracer in various configurations. The high degree of mixing observed shows the great potential of such innovative geometry in the field of photosynthetic microorganisms cultivation, especially for the design of a lab-scale process to conduct experiments under well-controlled conditions (light and flow) for modeling purpose. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This study is conducted with Scenedesmus obliquus, a species known for its ability to assimilate a wide variety of carbon sources. Autotrophic experiments are first conducted to obtain the typical behavior (growth curve and nutrient consumption rates) of the alga in standard medium composition. Mixotrophic experiments then follow: aside from productivity aspects, results show that bacterial contaminations can remain an issue at this scale, even for closed systems such as photobioreactors. It is however shown possible to exploit some intrinsic dynamic properties of the algae to limit bacterial growth, with no significant impact on algal growth and biomass productivity. Anionic analyses on the mixotrophic cultures show that particular attention should be drawn on the phosphate and sulfate ions for further process optimization.},

abstract = {A dynamic model of the relationship between light intensity and the rate of photosynthesis in phytoplankton has been developed. The model describes the photosynthetic processes and those connected with photoinhibition and recovery from photoinhibition. In this paper, the steady-state properties of the model are studied and a production curve is derived from it. Simple expressions are derived for the maximum production rate Pm, the optimal and characteristic intensities I m and lk, and the initial slope of the curve. A new dimensionless parameter is introduced that measures the degree of photoinhibition. An iterative least-squares algorithm provides an easy method for fitting the parameters of the curve. It is proposed to present production curves in a dimensionless form (p/pm VS. I/Im) on logarithmic scales. This is especially useful in comparing different photosynthetic models. Comparison of the curve with those of Vollenweider and Platt et al. shows that they all behave similarly, except at high light intensities. The main advantage of this model compared to empirical curves is its foundation on physiological mechanisms. This makes it possible to derive effects of temperature in a mechanistic way. A procedure is presented to integrate the phytoplankton production of a water column analytically.},

abstract = {Sustainability is a key principle in natural resource management, and it involves operational efficiency, minimisation of environmental impact and socio-economic considerations; all of which are interdependent. It has become increasingly obvious that continued reliance on fossil fuel energy resources is unsustainable, owing to both depleting world reserves and the green house gas emissions associated with their use. Therefore, there are vigorous research initiatives aimed at developing alternative renewable and potentially carbon neutral solid, liquid and gaseous biofuels as alternative energy resources. However, alternate energy resources akin to first generation biofuels derived from terrestrial crops such as sugarcane, sugar beet, maize and rapeseed place an enormous strain on world food markets, contribute to water shortages and precipitate the destruction of the world's forests. Second generation biofuels derived from lignocellulosic agriculture and forest residues and from non-food crop feedstocks address some of the above problems; however there is concern over competing land use or required land use changes. Therefore, based on current knowledge and technology projections, third generation biofuels specifically derived from microalgae are considered to be a technically viable alternative energy resource that is devoid of the major drawbacks associated with first and second generation biofuels. Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms with simple growing requirements (light, sugars, CO2, N, P, and K) that can produce lipids, proteins and carbohydrates in large amounts over short periods of time. These products can be processed into both biofuels and valuable co-products. This study reviewed the technologies underpinning microalgae-to-biofuels systems, focusing on the biomass production, harvesting, conversion technologies, and the extraction of useful co-products. It also reviewed the synergistic coupling of microalgae propagation with carbon sequestration and wastewater treatment potential for mitigation of environmental impacts associated with energy conversion and utilisation. It was found that, whereas there are outstanding issues related to photosynthetic efficiencies and biomass output, microalgae-derived biofuels could progressively substitute a significant proportion of the fossil fuels required to meet the growing energy demand. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microalgae are a potential source of sustainable commodities of fuels, chemicals and food and feed additives. The current high production costs, as a result of the low areal productivities, limit the application of microalgae in industry. A first step is determining how the different production system designs relate to each other under identical climate conditions. The productivity and photosynthetic efficiency of Nannochloropsis sp. CCAP 211/78 cultivated in four different outdoor continuously operated pilot-scale photobioreactors under the same climatological conditions were compared. The optimal dilution rate was determined for each photobioreactor by operation of the different photobioreactors at different dilution rates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In vertical photobioreactors, higher areal productivities and photosynthetic efficiencies, 19-24 g m(-2) day(-1) and 2.4-4.2 {\%}, respectively, were found in comparison to the horizontal systems; 12-15 g m(-2) day(-1) and 1.5-1.8 {\%}. The higher ground areal productivity in the vertical systems could be explained by light dilution in combination with a higher light capture. In the raceway pond low productivities were obtained, due to the long optical path in this system. Areal productivities in all systems increased with increasing photon flux densities up to a photon flux density of 30 mol m(-2) day(-1). Photosynthetic efficiencies remained constant in all systems with increasing photon flux densities. The highest photosynthetic efficiencies obtained were; 4.2 {\%} for the vertical tubular photobioreactor, 3.8 {\%} for the flat panel reactor, 1.8 {\%} for the horizontal tubular reactor, and 1.5 {\%} for the open raceway pond.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Vertical photobioreactors resulted in higher areal productivities than horizontal photobioreactors because of the lower incident photon flux densities on the reactor surface. The flat panel photobioreactor resulted, among the vertical photobioreactors studied, in the highest average photosynthetic efficiency, areal and volumetric productivities due to the short optical path. Photobioreactor light interception should be further optimized to maximize ground areal productivity and photosynthetic efficiency.},

abstract = {High Rate Algal Ponds with long, shallow, looped channels and powered by paddlewheels have been used since the late 1970s for growing algae to produce nutraceuticals and to remediate wastewater. These high rate or raceway ponds are also being applied to other fields such as CO2 capture and biodiesel production, where there is an ongoing effort to find ways of minimizing operating and capital costs. One approach for minimizing costs is to improve the energy efficiency of raceway ponds as this would lower operating costs and allow the construction of larger ponds, which should also lower capital costs. A major component of energy loss in a raceway pond is the energy required to circulate the fluid around the raceway, particularly at the hairpin bends.In order to design a low-energy consumption bend for a raceway pond, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was used to model different raceway bend configurations. These simulations assisted in the development of a novel bend design that can reduce the energy loss at a bend by around 87{\%} relative to the energy consumed at a conventional bend. This new design can also remove or reduce the incidence of stagnation regions within the flow. Such a development should, potentially, improve the productivity of algae in raceway ponds. {\textcopyright} 2012 .},

abstract = {Simulations of radiative transfer within an air-lift photobioreactor (PBR) are demonstrated by coupling it to the fluid hydrodynamics and employing wavelength dependant properties for the participating media. The radiative properties of the algal media are determined by matching the numerical predictions against measurements of radiative intensity distributions. To assist towards the design, scale-up and optimization of such reactors, a parametric investigation of the relative importance of the angular resolution of the radiation calculations, scattering phase functions of the bubbles, air mass flow rate and the bubble size are investigated by examining the 3D distributions of radiation within the PBR. Two hundred and eighty eight solid angles in the finite volume (FV) formulation of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) provide an optimum combination of speed and accuracy in the resulting calculations. While scattering results in a more effective redistribution of the energy, the results from employing isotropic and forward-scattering phase functions for the bubbles are found to be similar. The importance of bubble scattering diminishes at algal concentrations ({\textgreater}0.5. g/L) where the radiation attenuation is dominated by the absorption coefficient of the algal media. While 1. ??m sized bubbles more effectively redistribute the radiation downstream of the radiators compared to larger sized bubbles, the differences in the radiation profiles obtained from 10. ??m and 100. ??m-sized bubbles were small within this reactor. The radiation distributions are also influenced by the mass flow rate of air. The calculations demonstrate the need to rigorously account for the air flow rate, bubble size and the scattering effects of bubbles through fully coupled numerical solutions to the fluid flow and radiative transfer equations and provide some best practice guidelines for increasing the fidelity of radiation simulations in PBR's. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The proposed model constitutes a dynamic integration of the kinetics of photosynthesis and photoinhibition with the fluid dynamics of the bubble column, including the effects of shear stress on the kinetics of growth. The kinetic data used in the model were obtained in independent experiments run in a thin-film photobioreactor with defined light/dark cycles. The maintenance term was modified to take into account the effects of liquid flow in the bioreactor on the growth rate. A hybrid method proposed for the approximate solution of the equations gave an appreciable reduction of the calculation time. Extrapolations of the model indicated the possibility of predicting the optimal diameter for an assembly of bubble column photobioreactors. Satisfactory fit was found with the experimental results of biomass growth in a 13-liter bubble column.},

The radiative properties of the biological turbid medium were then deduced using the exact Lorenz-Mie theory. This method is experimentally validated using a large-size integrating sphere photometer. The radiative properties are then used in a rectangular, one-dimensional two-flux model to predict radiant light attenuation in a photobioreactor, considering a quasi-collimated field of irradiance.

abstract = {The goal of this research is to investigate heat transfer effects of two phase gas-liquid flows in a column photobioreactor (PBR) experimentally as well as computationally using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The authors have completed a preliminary study on bubble formation, rise and resulting circulation patterns using lab-scale experiments and CFD simulations. This study extends on this previous work by investigating the relationships of bubble drag coefficient and bubble Reynolds number with superficial gas velocity and a study of heat transfer within the PBR. It is hypothesized that a greater understanding the bubble movement patterns will aid in predicting heat transfer rates within the PBR. Dispersed gas-liquid flow in the rectangular column PBR are modeled using the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The heat transfer process has been considered for the case of a steady state three dimensional PBR. A low Reynolds number k-epsilon CFD model is used for the description of flow pattern near the wall. The velocity profiles and eddy diffusivity obtained by the model are utilized to predict heat transfer coefficients for different superficial gas velocities. The information on heat transfer effects between cooling or heating surfaces and a gas-liquid dispersed bed is essential for designing a PBR. Carbon dioxide, which is necessary for photosynthetic microalgae growth, is added to the system. Bubble size distribution measurements are carried out using a high-speed digital camera. The main interaction forces, i.e. the drag force, the added mass force, and lift force are considered. Heat transfer and internal hydrodynamics of a column reactor are studied and the numerical simulations results are presented for heat transfer and hydrodynamics in column PBRs. The results are validated with experimental data and with data from current literature. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 by ASME.},

abstract = {Due to their better operational advantages, such as good scalability, operational flexibility, high mass and heat transfer characteristics, homogenous shear stress, good mixing and better control over fluid circulation, airlift column photobioreactors (PBR) have become a promising design alternative for microalgae culture, among bubble column and other types of photobioreactors. The good hydrodynamic environment for fragile microorganisms in airlift columns have led to numerous investigations in order to understand the hydrodynamic phenomena of multiphase flow, particularly gasliquid, inside this type of PBR. In the present paper, a CFD (Computer Fluid Dynamics) simulation in CFX, ANSYS Inc. 11.0, is developed following a multiphase flow model with an Eulerian-Eulerian approach. For evaluating turbulence, the modified model is chosen. Gas holdup, gas superficial velocity and liquid velocity profiles for different heights column are obtained by varying air volumetric flow rates at 2, 5 and 8 L/min. Also gas holdup, gas superficial velocity and liquid velocity contours are obtained for a sequence of five step times. An experimental video validation to compare the multiphase flow behavior has been made with a high-resolution video camera. The experiments are carried out by using an airlift column photobioreactor with air supply by a porous sparger. The profiles of the hydrodynamic variables made for 5 different column heights show that the trends of gas holdup and gas superficial velocity are very similar and do not depend on the variation of inlet air flow. For the liquid velocity profiles, the trends don't show the same behavior, the profiles at lower heights are off-centered and less symmetric and the maximum velocities are reached at h=0.2 m. The time sequences with the variable contours are made to enhance the visualization and understanding of the hydrodynamic behavior, especially when air supply begins and the bubble plume starts to form.

This work presents a new method for the calculation of these light-dark patterns. The investigation is focused on temporal and spatial aspects of light patterns which may affect the photosynthetic reaction. The method combines computational fluid dynamics simulations of three-dimensional turbulent single-phase fluid flow with statistical particle tracking and signal analysis. In this way, light-dark phases are derived which affect singular (algal) cells. An example case is presented of a tubular photobioreactor in which static mixers are used for the efficient mixing of liquid and also of gases with liquid. Particle trajectories representing the path of algal cells were analysed to obtain light fluctuations on single cells. Particles were exposed to light-dark phases with frequencies between 3 and 25 Hz in a helical mixer at a mean velocity of 0.5 m s-1, which contrasts to the case of a tube without static mixers, where only frequencies of 0.2-3.1 Hz were obtained under the same conditions. The simulations show the potential of improving radial flow in a tubular photobioreactor by means of using a static mixer and the usefulness of CFD and trajectory analysis for scale-down/scale-up. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Novel flat-plate photobioreactors (PBRs) with special mixers (type-a, type-b, and type-c) were designed based on increased mixing degree along the light gradient. The hydrodynamic and light regime characteristic of the novel PBRs were investigated through computational fluid dynamics. Compared with the control reactor without mixer, the novel reactors can effectively increase liquid velocity along the light gradient, the frequency of light/dark (L/D) cycles, and the algal growth rates of Chlorella pyrenoidosa. The maximum biomass concentrations in type-a, type-b, and type-c reactors were 42.9{\%} (1.3gL-1), 31.9{\%} (1.2gL-1), and 20.9{\%} (1.1gL-1) higher than that in the control reactor (0.91gL-1), respectively, at an aeration rate of 1.0vvm. Correlation analysis of algal growth rate with the characteristics of mixing and light regime shows the key factors affecting algal photoautotrophic growth are liquid velocity along the light gradient and L/D cycles rather than the macro-mixing degree. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The hydrodynamics in a raceway reactor is studied experimentally and numerically. Effects of the paddlewheel speed and geometry are investigated. Simulations successfully predict the flow rate and the impeller power consumption. Mixing rates are related to the flow low-frequency unsteadiness. Even at moderate intensities, wind has a crucial impact on the hydrodynamics. a b s t r a c t Raceways are nowadays the most used large-scale reactors for microalgae culture. This paper focuses on the hydrodynamics in such a reactor, and emphasizes on the effects of the paddlewheel geometry (two impeller configurations are tested). The global hydrodynamics behavior of the raceway (flow velocity, mixing time) is characterized experimentally by the tracer pulse injection method, and local velocity measurements are acquired by Pulsed Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimetry. Finally, the flow is modeled by using the sliding-mesh CFD technique, a method overcoming many limitations of the simulation approaches used in the literature. CFD simulations successfully estimate the flow rate in the reactor and the power consumption of the paddlewheel. It is shown that the mixing efficiency in the raceway reactor is closely related to the low-frequency flow unsteadiness that arises from the periodic motion of the blades. Concerning local velocities, CFD and experimental data are in good agreement at some posi-tions in the reactor, but a significant disagreement is observed at some other locations. Taking into account the wind presence in the simulations reduces the discrepancy between the experimental and numerical results, showing that, even with a moderate intensity, wind has an important effect on the hydrodynamics in the reactor.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tubular photobioreactors are being considered for growing microalgae to produce renewable fuel oils via photosynthesis. Such bioreactors need to be highly energy efficient, or the energy captured in the fuel oil through photosynthesis will barely compensate for the fossil energy required to operate the photobioreactor. RESULTS: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the flow in a conventional tubular loop photobioreactor is used to reveal the existence of substantial dead zones in the typically used U-bends and 90° elbows. Fluid circulation in these dead zones leads to increased energy consumption, formation of deposits, wall growth and potentially reduced productivity. Alternative designs of U-bends and 90° elbows are evaluated by CFD modeling. Optimal design of a U-bend and a 90° elbow are identified and shown to substantially reduce the development of dead zones. Use of the proposed new configurations of bends is shown to reduce the energy consumption for fluid circulation in the loop by up to 15{\%} relative to a conventionally designed tubular loop photobioreactor, for turbulent flow of seawater. CONCLUSION: For a typical tubular loop made of a tube of 0.1 m in diameter, the optimal configuration of a U-bend had a radius of curvature of 0.35 m and an angle of the arc of 210°. The optimal configuration of a 90° elbow was found to have a radius of curvature of 0.3 m. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract = {Airlift reactors have been recognized as one of the promising photobioreactors for biomass/bio-energy production, where mixing has significant impact on the reactor performance. In recent years, using CFD simulations to track microorganism cells and to generate their trajectories in the reactor for reactor performance evaluations becomes more common. However, there is a lack of systematic and rigorous verifications and validations of the reliability of CFD models in particle tracking against experimental measurements in the open literature, which is vital for the faithful application of CFD in reactor design and scale-ups. In this work, we attempt to evaluate the reliability of using CFD simulations to generate trajectories of microorganisms in a draft tube column photobioreactor. A computationally promising CFD simulation model based on CFX5.7 was validated against a benchmark experimental database reported in Luo and Al-Dahhan (2008a, b, 2010). This model was then used to generate typical trajectories of microorganisms in the studied airlift column, which was further validated against experimentally measured tracer trajectories. The results indicated that the CFD model reasonably predicted the recirculation of the microorganism around the draft tube, however over-estimated the cells' residence time in the wall regions. Proper treatment for the wall region such as griding and wall function is needed to better capture the movement of microorganism cells in such bioreactors. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The kinetic parameters obtained previously for a system under defined light/dark cycles were used, and satisfactory agreement was found. The maintenance term was modified to take into account the detrimental effects of shear stress in the bioreactor on the rate of growth. A hybrid method for approximate solution of the equations is proposed. The conditions of gas flow rate and illuminance required for positive growth were found.

abstract = {In this work, different modeling approaches are used to study the hydrodynamics of gas-solid flows in a three-dimensional, lab-scale spouted fluidized bed. In particular, the simulation results obtained by the two-fluid model are compared with those of coupled CFD/DEM simulations. To explore the effects of the gas mass flow rate on the ability of the used simulation techniques to predict the flow behavior in the simulated test case, two different fluidization conditions are considered while maintaining the same computational set-up. The spouted fluidized bed has been evaluated by means of high-speed imaging for validating the simulation results. A comparative study of the two modeling approaches with experimental observations for bubble size in terms of the representative bubble diameter and the bed height has been carried out under both operating conditions. To identify significant simulation settings for the two-fluid model, a parameter study is carried out. The investigated input parameters include the gas-particle drag models, the granular temperature approach, the solid-phase wall boundary conditions in terms of specularity coefficient and the particle-particle restitution coefficient. At a gas mass flow rate of 0.005. kg/s, the predicted characteristics of the bubble formation and the bed expansion using both techniques are in very good agreement with experimental observations. Using the same validated settings, the two-fluid model shows some notable discrepancies when the gas mass flow rate is increased to 0.006. kg/s, while the DEM is more successful than the two-fluid model in reproducing realistic flow patterns. Although both techniques predict the right fluidization regimes and trends in bubble sizes and bed expansion, their results deviate significantly from the experimental data during the final stage of the bubble formation. The most important reasons for the differences in predicting the bed dynamics along with the advantages and limitations of the two approaches are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A 60L membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) was successfully employed to treat landfill leachate, which contained very high concentrations of refractory chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonium. Air or pure oxygen was supplied to the bioreactor through polydimethyl siloxane hollow fibre membranes. Over a year of operation with an average hydraulic retention time of about 5days, and influent ammonium concentrations ranging from 500 to 2500mg/L, the MABR achieved 80-99{\%} nitrification. Simultaneously, the influent COD concentrations which ranged from 1000 to 3000mg/L were reduced by approximately 200-500mg/L. Oxygen transfer rates as high as 35gO2/m2-day were achieved during the study. By operating at low gas flowrates, high oxygen transfer efficiencies were achieved without any negative impact on oxygen transfer rates. This suggested that the biofilm was not oxygen limited during this study. The very low gas flowrates and the low pressure losses required to move air through the membranes resulted in very high standard aeration efficiencies that exceeded 10kgO2/kWh. The results indicate that mixing energy far exceeded that required for aeration in this study. Our results suggest that with process optimisation, MABR technology offers a low energy option for effective leachate treatment.},

@article{Lapin2006,
abstract = {In the present work, an Euler–Lagrange approach has been applied to characterize the behavior of a heterogeneous cell population in a stirred-tank bioreactor with non-ideal mixing. It allows one to describe population behavior as the outcome of the interaction between the intracellular state of its individual cell and the turbulent flow field in the reactor. The modeling approach and the numerical method employed are based on an Euler–Lagrange formulation of the system combined with a fractional-step method to allow for a stable, accurate, and numerically efficient solution of the underlying equations. This strategy permits one to account for the heterogeneity present in real reactors in both the abiotic and biotic phases. The example of sugar uptake (phosphotransferase system, PTS) of E. coli cells growing in a fed-batch culture is used to illustrate the application of the approach. The activity of the uptake system depends on the local concentration of glucose as well as the ratio of the intracellular concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate, which in turn is a function of the history of the individual cell. The simulation results point to distinct differences in the viability of the cells at different scale of operation.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews various types of proposed biohydrogen processes, including dark fermentations, along with the potentially limiting factors. Several mechanisms by which photosynthesis could yield hydrogen (H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater})'such as direct biophotolysis, indirect biophotolysis, and photofermentations'are also examined in the chapter. The basis for any biological H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-producing system is an enzyme that reduces protons to hydrogen. Currently, the three known enzymes that carry out this reaction are nitrogenase, Fe-hydrogenase, and NiFe hydrogenase. The catalytic activity of these enzymes varies enormously, and it is in theory possible that at least in some cases the quantity or activity of the H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} evolving enzyme could limit the overall process. In theory, photosynthetic efficiencies could be as high as 10{\%} (conversion of total light energy into product). However, under full sunlight conditions, up to 90{\%} of the photons captured by the photosynthetic apparatus are not used in productive photosynthesis but rather decay as heat or fluorescence. Improving photosynthetic efficiencies is essential to the realization of practical microalgal processes for H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} production. Fermentative processes present an interesting yet largely unexplored avenue for the biological production of H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. One fermentation of interest would be to harness the endogenous metabolic machinery of algal cells to quantitatively convert stored carbohydrate (starch or glycogen in green algae and cyanobacteria, respectively) to H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} in a strictly dark reaction. In this case, the critical factor is the amount of H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} that can be produced per mole of substrate.},

abstract = {In this contribution experimental data and simulations of growth and product formation of the unicellular microalgae Porphyridium purpureum are presented. A mathematical model has been developed for a better understanding of growth and product formation in production plants. The model has been refined with the results of several cultivations in a new photobioreactor designed especially for the study of microalgal kinetics under highly defined illumination conditions. In this photobioreactor light is generated by an external light source and then distributed by means of optical fibres into an internal draft tube which also serves as irradiation element. All cultivations were performed in turbidostate mode. The influence of different light intensity changes, including stepwise change and light–dark cycles in the range from millisecond to second, has been investigated and the results were integrated into the mathematical model. The structured mathematical model consists of three levels: metabolic flux, control of macromolecules and the reactor level. A new linear optimization approach has been realized, enabling the model to describe even very different cultivation conditions. Output variables are among others the commercially interesting macromolecules of the microalgae, e.g. polysaccharides, pigments and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus, reliable predictions of the specific production rates of these products are possible for the production in a larger scale.},

abstract = {The relationship between growth rates of algae and structure parameters of closed flat-panel photobioreactors was investigated. Ad/Ar (cross-section area of the downcomer/cross-section area of the riser), h(0) (clearance from the upper edge of the baffles to the water level), and h(1) (clearance from the lower edge of the baffles to the bottom of the reactor) were selected as the inner structure parameters. CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) was used to simulate the hydrodynamic parameter (TKE)(d) (turbulence kinetic energy of the downcomers) and the secondary parameters epsilon (ratio between td and tc), tc (cycle time), and DZ (dead zones), which were deduced from the hydrodynamic parameters mentioned above. The effects of (TKE)(d,) epsilon, tc, DZ, and the inner structure parameters on cell growth of Isochrysis galbana 3011 were analyzed using data collected in 15-L airlift flat-panel photobioreactors. A model was developed to predict algae cell growth based on these inner structure parameters, thereby providing a new method for photobioreactor optimization. Validity of the model was confirmed by experimental data of I. galbana 3011 cultured in 15-L and 300-L photobioreactors, respectively. Finally, the prospect of applying CFD to photobioreactor optimization was discussed.},

abstract = {Since 1990, the Fluids Engineering Division of ASME has pursued activities concerning the detection, estimation and control of numerical uncertainty and/or error in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies. The first quality-control measures in this area were issued in 1986 (1986, “Editorial Policy Statement on Control of Numerical Accuracy ,” ASME J. Fluids Eng., 108, p. 2) and revised in 1993 (1993, “Journal of Fluids Engineering Editorial Policy Statement on the Control of Numerical Accuracy ,” ASME J. Fluids Eng., 115, pp. 339–340). Given the continued increase in CFD related publications, and the many significant advancements in computational techniques and computer technology, it has become necessary to revisit the issue and formulate a more detailed policy to further improve the quality of publications in this area. This brief note provides specific guidelines for prospective authors for calculation and reporting of discretization error estimates in CFD simulations where experimental data may or may not be available for comparison. The underlying perspective is that CFD-related studies will eventually aim to predict the outcome of a physical event for which experimental data is not available. It should be emphasized that the requirements outlined in this note do not preclude those already published in the previous two policy statements. It is also important to keep in mind that the procedure recommended in this note cannot possibly encompass all possible scenarios or applications.},

@article{Wu2001,
abstract = {A mathematical representation of the growth of a photosynthetic system in an alternating light/dark regime is proposed, integrating fluid dynamics and maintenance in the three-state model developed earlier by Eilers and Peeters (1998, Ecological Modeling, 42, 199-215). The model was solved analytically and the constants were fitted to experimental data obtained in a thin film tubular reactor. The theoretical prediction that the introduction of light/dark cycle may enhance the growth, was confirmed by the experimental results, supporting the idea of utilizing ordered mixing to obtain more efficient growth. The model allows to predict collapse of cultures in photobioreactors either under light-deficit or light-excess conditions, as well as the influence of mixing on these critical phenomena. It has also been shown that chlorophyll fluorescence measurements can be used to estimate the growth at steady state. This paper presents an approach to model the kinetics of photosynthetic systems for photobioreactor design under conditions of simultaneous occurrence of photoinhibition in one region of the reactor, and photolimitation in another. The model takes into account the movement of the cells from one region to the other. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Gradients of glucose in time and space are shown in a 30 m3 cultivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in minimal medium to a cell density of 20 g l-1. The fed-batch concept was used with glucose as the limiting component which was fed continuously to the process. As the mean glucose concentration declined throughout the process, the level of glucose was at all times different in three sampling ports (bottom/middle/top) of the reactor. These gradients were furthermore shown to depend on the feed position. This means that if the feed was supplied in the relatively stagnant mixing zone above the top impeller, the gradients were more pronounced than by feed in the well mixed bottom impeller zone. A rapid sampling system was constructed, and continuous glucose samples of every 0.15 s were analysed from a point of the reactor. Fifty samples were collected with this system, but the amount and frequency is possible to change. The results of these series show a variance of the glucose concentration where at one stage, a peak appeared of a relative difference in concentration of 40 mg l-1. The pattern of these rapid glucose fluctuations was shown to depend on the turbulence level at the location of the feed. It was shown, that the fluctuations were more pronounced when the feed was localised in a relatively stagnant area than in the well-mixed impeller area, where the deviation from the mean was negligible. The fluid flow, in the impeller (gassed and ungassed) and bulk area (ungassed) of the reactor, was characterised by turbulence measurements using thermal anemometry. These types of areas resembles well the different areas of sampling as mentioned above. The turbulent frequencies in these areas were in the range of 10-1 to 104 Hz with the highest amplitudes at low frequencies. The spectra depicts a uniform time scale for all zones, especially at the low frequencies. The dominance of low frequency, high amplitude flow variations and the observed short-time oscillations in substrate concentration support the hypothesis of substrate transport over fairly long distances without substantial mixing both in the impeller, but especially, in the bulk zone of the reactor. Simulations with an integrated CFD and biokinetic model were performed. The predictions of the glucose gradients of this model were compared to measurements.},

abstract = {In the present study depth profiles of light, oxygen, pH and photosynthetic performance in an artificial biofilm of the green alga Halochlorella rubescens in a porous substrate photobioreactor were recorded with microsensors. Biofilms were exposed to different light intensities (50-1,000 µmol photons m(-2) s(-1) ) and CO2 levels (0.04-5{\{}{\%}{\}} v/v in air). The distribution of photosynthetically active radiation showed almost identical trends for different surface irradiances, namely: a relatively fast drop to a depth of about 250 µm, (to 5{\{}{\%}{\}} of the incident), followed by a slower decrease. Light penetrated into the biofilm deeper than the Lambert-Beer Law predicted, which may be attributed to forward scattering of light, thus improving the overall light availability. Oxygen concentration profiles showed maxima at a depth between 50 and 150 µm, depending on the incident light intensity. A very fast gas exchange was observed at the biofilm surface. The highest oxygen concentration of 3.2 mM was measured with 1,000 µmol photons m(-2) s(-1) and 5{\{}{\%}{\}} supplementary CO2 . Photosynthetic productivity increased with light intensity and/or CO2 concentration and was always highest at the biofilm surface; the stimulating effect of elevated CO2 concentration in the gas phase on photosynthesis was enhanced by higher light intensities. The dissolved inorganic carbon concentration profiles suggest that the availability of the dissolved free CO2 has the strongest impact on photosynthetic productivity. The results suggest that dark respiration could explain previously observed decrease in growth rate over cultivation time in this type of PSBR. Our results represent a basis for understanding the complex dynamics of environmental variables and metabolic processes in artificial phototrophic biofilms exposed to a gas phase and can be used to improve the design and operational parameters of PSBRs.

Although open pond cultivation is most affordable option, there tends to be insufficient control on growth conditions and the risk of contamination. In contrast, while providing minimal risk of contamination, closed photobioreactors offer better control on culture conditions, such as: CO2 supply, water supply, optimal temperatures, efficient exposure to light, culture density, pH levels, and mixing rates. For a large scale production of biomass, efficient photobioreactors are required. This review paper describes general design considerations pertaining to photobioreactor systems, in order to cultivate microalgae for biomass production.

abstract = {Turbulent flows in a single-stage and a two-stage impeller-stirred photobioreactor with a simple geometric configuration were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. The trajectories of the microorganisms entrained in the flow field were traced by the particle tracking method. By projecting these trajectories onto a radial-axial (. r-. z) plane with a given azimuth angle, we were able to observe four different dynamics zones: circulation, pure rotation, trap, and slow-motion. Within the pure rotation zone, turbulence can be observed near the edges of the impeller. The light intensity and the light/dark cycles subjected by the microorganisms differ significantly in these zones. These differences can be further changed by providing different incident light illuminations on the reactor surface. The dynamics zones can be altered by modifying the geometric configuration of the reactor and the impeller stirring mechanism. In combination with the utilization of different incident light illuminations, the light intensity dynamics and the light/dark cycles subjected by the microorganisms can be controlled such that an optimal photobioreactor design with a high efficiency of light utilization and a high formation rate of the biochemical products can be realized. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Relevant literatures and experiments show that there is a significant influence of light-dark cycles on microalgae yield. In this work, a flat plate airlift photobioreactor with two panels (2-panel PBR) was therefore investigated to obtain prescribed light regime of light-dark cycle and realize highly-effective microalgae cultivation. The governing equations coupled by laminar bubbly flow with microalgae mass transfer equation and boundary conditions were firstly developed to theoretically study the optimum geometric configuration and operating parameters of the 2-panel PBR which were supposed to provide expected light-dark cycle by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. The 2-panel PBR prototype was then built from mathematical model and digital simulation. Finally, the prototype experiments on microalgae cultivation suggested that the mathematical model was sufficiently valid, and the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris was high-effectively cultivated under the prescribed light regime of light-dark cycle in this 2-panel PBR which could be extensively used in ecological engineering fields and microalgae-based industries.},

abstract = {A numerical framework for simulating biomass fast pyrolysis is developed in this study. Fast pyrolysis, a thermochemical conversion process converting low-value lingo-cellulosic biomass to various useful products has gained increased interest. This study is to develop an open-source computational tool to help understand the complex phenomena involved within the biomass fast pyrolysis process. In this framework, a multi-fluid model is applied to simulate the multi-phase hydrodynamics while global reaction kinetics is used to describe the physicochemical conversion. The coupling of these two methodologies is realized by a time-splitting method. The model results are validated using experimental data from fast pyrolysis reactors. Good levels of agreement are obtained in the product distribution including tar, biochar, and syngas. The parametric study also indicates that the tar yield can be increased if the biomass injector location is elevated or the superficial velocity of the feeding nitrogen is increased. One feature of the present numerical framework is that sub-models for different constitutive hydrodynamic relations and chemical reactions can be readily incorporated into this framework owing to the object-oriented feature of the baseline code. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The high cost of microalgae cultivation is one of the major hurdles in large scale production of microalgal biofuels. Cultivation in closed photobioreactors (PBR) to achieve high culture concentrations is a potential solution. However, existing PBR designs do not have the desired efficiencies, and lead to high material and energy costs. Therefore, novel PBR designs need to be developed and benchmarked against existing designs. This work has proposed a novel PBR design by combining two existing designs, namely, the airlift and flat plate PBRs. The novel design uses the concept of riser and downcomer from the airlift PBR. However, the downcomer has flat surfaces resembling a flat plate PBR. The hydrodynamic performance of the novel PBR was studied using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and the performance was compared with that of the conventional airlift PBR. The dimensions of the novel design were then optimized using CFD simulations. The results showed that the novel design had superior liquid circulation properties that resulted in a regular and alternative exposure to light and dark regions of the PBR. The novel design also had about 7{\%} higher surface area to volume ratio as compared to a conventional airlift PBR.},

abstract = {This project investigates the effects of sparger geometry and placement on bubble and fluid flow patterns and convective heat transfer within a column photobioreactor (PBR) using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Experimental and computational studies have been completed that focused on the hydrodynamics and heat transfer within a rectangular column photobioreactor (34.29 cm long x x 15.25 cm wide x 34.29 cm tall) with a single sparger located at the center of its base (33.02 cm X 1.27 cm) running lengthwise. This study extends previous work by investigating the flow patterns and heat transfer effects due to full bottom sparger or porous sparger. The gas bubbles and the water-based media within the photobioreactor are modeled using the Lagrangian-Eulerian approach. A low Reynolds k-Epsilon turbulence model is used to predict near-wall flow patterns. A flat surface photobioreactor is used to achieve sufficient light penetration into the system. The main interaction forces between the bubbles and the media, including drag forces, added mass forces, and lift forces are considered. The overarching goal of this research is to produce biofuels and bioproducts through the improved design of column PBRs used for microalgae production. An important factor in designing photobioreactors is the appropriate selection of sparger geometry and placement. The sparger governs the bubble size distribution and gas holdup. These factors in turn influence flow pattern, effective interfacial area, rates of mass transfer, heat transfer, and mixing. It is hypothesized that increasing the sparger width will improve uniformity of bubble distribution as well as mixing. Despite its importance, optimizing the sparger geometry and placement in PBRs for microalgae production is still largely not understood. In this study, the simulation's results are presented for various spargers, which can be helpful in designing appropriate sparger geometry and proper placement for increased microalgae production.},

abstract = {A spectral radiation-transport model was integrated with a three dimensional computational fluid dynamics model to simulate the hydrodynamics and light transfer in open raceway ponds (ORPs). The predicted three-dimensional velocity and light intensity agreed well with measured values collected on a lab-scale ORP. However, there was a slight difference in the predicted velocity profiles using two different types of boundaries for the paddlewheel, i.e., the moving zone boundary and inlet velocity boundary, with R2 values between the predicted and measured velocities of 0.9947 and 0.9838, respectively. The R2 value between the predicted and measured light intensity was 0.9939. Simulations were further conducted on a large-scale ORP with 100 m2 surface area operated at total medium depths of 0.2 and 0.3 m, average cell concentration of 0.4 g/L, and inlet velocities of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 m/s from the paddlewheel. The increase of inlet flow velocity from 0.1 to 0.2 m/s resulted in a more uniform cell concentration profile. However, when the inlet velocity was further increased from 0.2 to 0.3 m/s, there was only a slight increase in the uniformity of the cell concentration. In addition, the simulation results showed that sedimentation of cells more likely occurred at the bottom of the ORP with a total medium depth of 0.2 m than at 0.3 m at the same inlet velocity. The increase of inlet velocity from the paddlewheel resulted in a uniformly distributed light intensity in the region near the medium surface (e.g., 0.05 m depth from the surface) owing to improved mixing. However, owing to a sudden drop in the light intensity after a few centimeters from the medium surface, the cell sedimentation that occurred at the bottom of the ORPs had negligible effects on the light penetration depth in the medium.},

abstract = {This work describes the procedure for the simulation of the operation of a photocatalytic reactor by using a multiphysics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on the determination of the intrinsic kinetics parameters in an optically differential photoreactor. The model includes the rigorous description of the hydrodynamics, radiation transfer, mass transport and chemical reaction rate based on a mechanistic kinetic model. Possible existence of dead and recirculation zones has been identified from the flow field, showing a non-uniform flow through the reactor domain. The theoretical laminar profile is not reached due to the short length of the annular core and the departure from the ideal models has been quantified. The predicted velocity field has been experimentally validated with good agreement by injecting a tracer. The radiation field was simulated for slurry TiO2 suspensions with concentrations between 0.005 and 5??g??L???1, showing an optimum catalyst loading around 0.1???0.2??g??L???1. Above this value, the increase in the absorption of radiation is negligible, whereas a more non-uniform radiation profile develops, keeping the most external regions of the reactor in the dark. The results of photocatalytic activity, using methanol oxidation as test reaction, showed good agreement between model predictions and experimental data, with errors between 2{\%} and 10{\%} depending on the catalyst concentration. The successful validation confirms not only the scientific background of the model, but also supports its applicability for engineering purposes in the design and optimization of large scale photocatalytic reactor to overcome some of limitations hindering the industrial development of this technology.},

abstract = {Alternative domestic wastewater treatment processes that recover energy and nutrients while achieving acceptable nutrient limits ({\textless}5 mgNL{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) are a key challenge. Major drivers are value and availability of phosphorous, nitrogen, and potassium, and increasing energy costs. The two major platforms that can achieve this are (a) low energy mainline (LEM), with low strength anaerobic treatment, followed by mainline anaerobic nitrogen removal and chemical or adsorptive phosphorous removal and (b) partition-release-recover (PRR), in which carbon and nutrients are partitioned to solids through either heterotrophic or phototrophic microbes, followed by anaerobic digestion of these solids and recovery from the digestate. This paper reviews practical application of these processes, with a focus on energy costs. Compared to conventional processes which require 0.5 kWhkL{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} electricity (500 mgCODL{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} influent concentration), PRR requires only 0.05kWhkL{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} electricity. LEM offers the possibility to recover 0.1kWhkL{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} as electricity with net energy generation above 400mgCODL{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}influent, while PRR becomes energy generating at 650mgCODL{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. PRR offers the possibility for recovery of nitrogen and other nutrients (including potassium) through assimilative recovery. However, the energetic overhead of this is substantial, requiring 5kWhkgN{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} as electricity, which compares to ammonia fixation costs. The lower energy costs, and near to market status of LEM treatment make it likely as a recovery platform in the shorter term, while ability to recover other elements such as nitrogen and potassium, as well as enhance favourability on concentrated wastewaters may enhance the desirability of partitioning in the longer term.},

abstract = {The present paper is the lead article in a three-part series on anisotropic mesh adaptation and its applications to structured and unstructured meshes. A flexible approach is proposed and tested on two-dimensional, inviscid and viscous, finite volume and finite element flow solvers, over a wide range of speeds. The directional properties of an interpolation-based error estimate, extracted from the Hessian of the solution, are used to control the size and orientation of mesh edges. The approach is encapsulated into an edge-based anisotropic mesh optimization methodology (MOM), which uses a judicious sequence of four local operations: refinement, coarsening, edge swapping and point movement, to equi-distribute the error estimate along all edges, without any recourse to remeshing. The mesh adaptation convergence of the MOM loop is carefully studied for a wide variety of test cases. The mesh optimization generic coupling of MOM with finite volume and finite element flow solvers is shown to yield the same final mesh no matter what the starting point is. It is also shown that on such optimized meshes, the need for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) stabilization artifices, such as upwinding or artificial viscosity, are drastically reduced, if not altogether eliminated, in most well-posed formulations. These two conclusions can be considered significant steps towards mesh-independent and solver-independent CFD. The struc- ture of the three-part series is thus, 1, general principles; 2, methodology and applications to structured and unstructured grids; 3, applications to three-dimensional flows.},

abstract = {Population balance models (PBMs) represent a powerful modelling framework for the description of the dynamics of properties that are characterised by distributions. This distribution of properties under transient conditions has been demonstrated in many chemical engineering applications. Modelling efforts of several current and future unit processes in wastewater treatment plants could potentially benefit from this framework, especially when distributed dynamics have a significant impact on the overall unit process performance. In these cases, current models that rely on average properties cannot sufficiently capture the true behaviour and even lead to completely wrong conclusions. Examples of distributed properties are bubble size, floc size, crystal size or granule size. In these cases, PBMs can be used to develop new knowledge that can be embedded in our current models to improve their predictive capability. Hence, PBMs should be regarded as a complementary modelling framework to biokinetic models. This paper provides an overview of current applications, future potential and limitations of PBMs in the field of wastewater treatment modelling, thereby looking over the fence to other scientific disciplines.},

abstract = {Verification and validation (V{\{}{\&}{\}}V) are the primary means to assess accuracy and reliability in computational simulations. This paper presents an extensive review of the literature in V{\{}{\&}{\}}V in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing V{\{}{\&}{\}}V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review of the development of V{\{}{\&}{\}}V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V{\{}{\&}{\}}V are addressed, such as code verification versus solution verification, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors' contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V{\{}{\&}{\}}V, the paper concludes with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions for needed changes in the implementation of V{\{}{\&}{\}}V in production and commercial software.},

However, the future of CFD models and their value to the wastewater field are a function of their proper application and knowledge of their limits. As has been established for other types of wastewater modelling (i.e. biokinetic models), it is timely to define a good modelling practice (GMP) for wastewater CFD applications. An International Water Association (IWA) working group has been formed to investigate a variety of issues and challenges related to CFD modelling in water and WWT. This paper summarizes the recommendations for GMP of the IWA working group on CFD. The paper provides an overview of GMP and, though it is written for the wastewater application, is based on general CFD procedures. A forthcoming companion paper to provide specific details on modelling of individual wastewater components forms the next step of the working group.},

CH4 emissions were equal for the three treatments (p??{\textgreater}??0.05). CO2 emissions significantly increased in microalgal biofilm treatment (p??{\textless}??0.01), which was also responsible for the highest N2O emissions (p??{\textless}??0.01).

The main differences in soil characteristics were an increase in nitrogen and an increase in cation exchange capacity (p??{\textless}??0.01) caused by the algal biomass application to the soil. The soil organic matter content significantly differed (p??{\textless}??0.05) among the three treatments, with the microalgal biofilm treatment having the greatest increase in soil organic matter. Significant differences were observed for shoot dry matter mass and nitrogen content in the plants from both treatments where nitrogen sources were applied.

The effect of lift force and numerical diffusion on the dynamic and time-averaged properties is discussed in detail. Further, the results obtained using the Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations were compared with the Eulerian-Eulerian simulations. The bubble scale information, which is otherwise lost in the Eulerian-Eulerian simulations, was validated using the voidage fluctuation measurements.

abstract = {This study proposes a new design of the internally radiating photobioreactor, which combines the advantages of an air-lift bioreactor and an internally radiating system, and an efficient way of supplying light energy into the photobioreactor during cell cultivation. For a model photosynthetic microorganism, Synechococcus PCC 6301 wascultivated in an internally radiating air-lift photobioreactor. The light condition inside the photobioreactor was characterized by the average light intensity which was calculated from the light distribution model. Since excessive light energy induced photoinhibition at the early growth stage, the strategy of lumostatic operation was developed in order to maintain the light condition at an appropriate level during cell cultivation. Based on thecalculation results of the light distribution model, the average light intensitywas regulated at 30, 60, or 90 µmol m-2 s-1 byincreasing the number of light radiators. The model-based control of irradiating level enabled us to harvest a larger amount of cells withoutshowing the photoinhibited growth. Other favorable results included thereduction of cultivation time and lower consumption of irradiating power.},

In the present work, we have experimentally as well as computationally studied the effect of gas velocity, sparger design and coalescence suppressing additives on dynamics of gas-liquid flow in a rectangular bubble column. Wall pressure fluctuations were measured to characterize the low frequency oscillations of the meandering bubble plume. Bubble size distribution measurements were carried out using high-speed digital camera. Dispersed gas-liquid flow in bubble column was modelled using Eulerian-Eulerian approach. Bubble population was represented in the model with a single group or multiple groups. Bubble coalescence and break-up processes were included in the multi-group simulations via a suitable population balance framework. Effect of superficial gas velocity and sparger configurations was studied using single-group simulations. Model predictions were verified by comparison with the experimental data. Role of bubble size in determining plume oscillation period was studied. Multi-group simulations were carried out to examine evolution of bubble size distribution. An attempt is made to understand the relationship between local and global (over all the dispersion volume) bubble size distribution. The models and results reported here would be useful to develop and to extend the applications of multi-group CFD models. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Evolving improvements in computer speed and memory and improved software for implementing CFD, as well as for integrated processes, has allowed for broader usage of this tool for understanding, troubleshooting, and optimal design of WWTP unit processes.

abstract = {A newly designed and constructed LED illumination device for commercial cylindrical bioreactors is presented for application in microalgal cultivations and investigation of growth kinetics. An ideally illuminated volume is achieved by focusing the light toward the center of the reactor and thereby compensating the mutual shading of the cells. The relevant biomass concentration for homogeneous illumination depending on reactor radius was determined by light distribution measurements for Chlamydomonas to 0.2 g/L (equal 0.435 optical density at 750 nm). It is shown that cultivation experiments with the newly designed illumination device operated in batch mode can be successfully applied for determination of growth rates and photo conversion efficiencies. The exact knowledge of physiological reactions of specific strain(s) and the estimation of relevant parameters for scale-up can be used for construction of economic pilot plant photobioreactors. The determination of light-dependent kinetics of growth and product formation is the first necessary step to achieve this. A wide variety of different parameters can be examined like the effect of different illumination conditions (light intensity, frequency of day/night cycles, flashing light, light color...) and thereby for each single application specific, relevant, and interesting parameters will be examined. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

If the 2D laminar model is applied for calculations the dynamic character of the flow field can be resolved, but the simulation results depend strongly on the space resolution used. If the 2D k-?? turbulence model is used instead, the grid independent solution can be achieved on a relatively coarse grid, but the dynamic nature of the flow is not reproduced in the simulation. Only if the 3D turbulent model is used, the simulation results show a good agreement with experiments. This means, that the three-dimensional effects which are neglected in the 2D simulation have a strong influence on the numerical solution. Further, the influence of the discretization on the accuracy of the solution is discussed, and a comparison between results obtained with 2D Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange models is presented.},

abstract = {Nowadays, one of the major challenges in the wastewater sector is the successful design and reliable operation of treatment processes, which guarantee high treatment efficiencies to comply with effluent quality criteria, while keeping the investment and operating cost as low as possible. Although conceptual design and process control of activated sludge plants are key to ensuring these goals, they are still based on general empirical guidelines and operators' experience, dominated often by rule of thumb. This review paper discusses the rationale behind the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to model aeration, facilitating enhancement of treatment efficiency and reduction of energy input. Several single- and multiphase approaches commonly used in CFD studies of aeration tank operation, are comprehensively described, whilst the shortcomings of the modelling assumptions imposed to evaluate mixing and mass transfer in AS tanks are identified and discussed. Examples and methods of coupling of CFD data with biokinetics, accounting for the actual flow field and its impact on the oxygen mass transfer and yield of the biological processes occurring in the aeration tanks, are also critically discussed. Finally, modelling issues, which remain unaddressed, (e.g. coupling of the AS tank with secondary clarifier and the use of population balance models to simulate bubbly flow or flocculation of the activated sludge), are also identified and discussed.},

The numerical results obtained with the two methods were compared with the experimental data. The comparison shows that both of the methods can well predict the steady-state particle concentration distribution, while the Lagrangian method was computationally more demanding. The two models were further compared in predicting the transient dispersion of the particles from a coughing passenger in a section of airliner cabin. In the unsteady state condition, the Lagrangian method performed better than the Eulerian method. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A good understanding of the mechanical stability of biofilms is essential for biofouling management, particularly when mechanical forces are used. Previous biofilm studies lack a damage-based theoretical model to describe the biofilm separation from a surface. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the interfacial separation of a mature biofilm from a rigid glass substrate using a combined experimental and numerical modelling approach. In the current work, the biofilm-glass interfacial separation process was investigated under tensile and shear stresses at the macroscale level, known as modes I and II failure mechanisms respectively. The numerical simulations were performed using a Finite Volume (FV)-based simulation package (OpenFOAM??) to predict the separation initiation using the cohesive zone model (CZM). Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based retraction curve was used to obtain the separation properties between the biofilm and glass colloid at microscale level, where the CZM parameters were estimated using the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model. In this study CZM is introduced as a reliable method for the investigation of interfacial separation between a biofilm and rigid substrate, in which a high local stress at the interface edge acts as an ultimate stress at the crack tip. This study demonstrated that the total interfacial failure energy measured at the macroscale, was significantly higher than the pure interfacial separation energy obtained by AFM at the microscale, indicating a highly ductile deformation behaviour within the bulk biofilm matrix. The results of this study can significantly contribute to the understanding of biofilm detachments.},

abstract = {This study provides design and operational guidelines for achieving maximum biomass productivity in outdoor photobioreactors (PBRs). Detailed simulations of coupled light transfer and growth kinetics of microalgae were performed for open ponds, vertical flat-plate, and tubular PBRs operated in batch mode and exposed to time-dependent collimated and diffuse solar irradiance. The temporal evolution of microalgae concentration was predicted by accounting for light saturation, photoinhibition, and respiration. Three-dimensional spectral light transfer simulations of collimated and diffuse solar radiation in the PBRs were performed at different times of the day. The green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was used for illustration purposes. The study demonstrated that the daily productivity per unit of illuminated surface area for PBRs operated in batch mode was identical and depended uniquely on the ratio X0 / a where X0 is the initial microalgae concentration and a is the illuminated surface area per unit volume of PBR. A maximum daily productivity of about 0.045kg/m2/day was achieved for X0 / a = 0.035 kg / m2. Remarkably, similar results were obtained with experimental data and other simulation results based on different models reported in the literature, for different microorganisms and PBRs operated in continuous mode. The PBR optical thickness, represented by X0 / a, constitutes a convenient parameter for designing (via a) and operating (via X0) these PBRs to achieve their maximum performance. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Calculating the path of rays of light, so-called ray tracing, is used to determine local light intensities inside the photobioreactor based on the focused rays of sunlight. Reflection and refraction of the propagating rays of sunlight from point of focus to refraction into the photobioreactor is calculated. Refraction out of smooth and sandblasted distributor surfaces is simulated. For the sandblasted surface a specific structure is assumed and corresponding reflection and refraction patterns are described by a 2-dimensional modeling approach. Results of the simulations are validated by measurements on real light guide surfaces. The validated model is used to determine the influence of the solar angle on the uniformity and efficiency of light distribution over the light distributor surface. The simulations show that efficient capturing of sunlight and redistribution inside the algal biomass can be achieved in the Green Solar Collector at higher elevation angles of the sun, making the Green Solar Collector suitable for operation at low latitudes with a high level of direct irradiance. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The potential of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) for regenerative medicine is unquestionable, but practical and ethical considerations have hampered clinical application and research. In an attempt to overcome these issues, the conversion of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells similar to ESCs, commonly termed nuclear reprogramming, has been a top objective of contemporary biology. More than 40 years ago, King, Briggs, and Gurdon pioneered somatic cell nuclear reprogramming in frogs, and in 1981 Evans successfully isolated mouse ESCs. In 1997 Wilmut and collaborators produced the first cloned mammal using nuclear transfer, and then Thomson obtained human ESCs from in vitro fertilized blastocysts in 1998. Over the last 2 decades we have also seen remarkable findings regarding how ESC behavior is controlled, the importance of which should not be underestimated. This knowledge allowed the laboratory of Shinya Yamanaka to overcome brilliantly conceptual and technical barriers in 2006 and generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse fibroblasts by overexpressing defined combinations of ESC-enriched transcription factors. Here, we discuss some important implications of human iPSCs for biology and medicine and also point to possible future directions.},

However, major challenges to the implementation of an integrated system include the large-scale production of algae and the harvesting of microalgae in a way that allows for downstream processing to produce biofuels and other bioproducts of value. Although the majority of algal production systems use suspended cultures in either open ponds or closed reactors, the use of attached cultures may offer several advantages. With regard to harvesting methods, better understanding and control of autoflocculation and bioflocculation could improve performance and reduce chemical addition requirements for conventional mechanical methods that include centrifugation, tangential filtration, gravity sedimentation, and dissolved air flotation. There are many approaches currently used by companies and industries using clean water at laboratory, bench, and pilot scale; however, large-scale systems for controlled algae production and/or harvesting for wastewater treatment and subsequent processing for bioproducts are lacking. Further investigation and development of large-scale production and harvesting methods for biofuels and bioproducts are necessary, particularly with less studied but promising approaches such as those involving attached algal biofilm cultures. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Bubble-size distributions and flow fields in bubble columns are calculated numerically. The population balance is simplified and reduced to a balance equation for the average bubble volume. Models developed predict the rate of bubble breakup and coalescence based on physical principles. The flow fields are numerically calculated for bubble columns with cylindrical cross sections using the Euler-Euler method. The newly derived balance equations for the average bubble volumes are implemented into a commercial CFD code. The solutions of the balance equation for high superficial gas velocities result mainly in two fractions: one for the fraction with small and the other for the fraction with large bubble diameters. Both are considered pseudocontinuous phases, in addition to the liquid phase. The calculated flow fields are characterized by several large-scale vortices. The local volume fractions of gas and liquid are locally inhomogeneous and highly time-dependent. The time-averaged flow field is axisymmetric and stationary. The calculated volume fractions, velocities, and bubble-size distributions agree well with existing and previously published experimental results for bubble columns up to 0.3 m in diameter.},

abstract = {This paper describes an extension and validation of the Euler/Lagrange approach for time-dependent calculations of the flow evolving in a bubble column. The continuous phase velocity is obtained by solving the two-dimensional axisymmetric Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations augmented by the k–$\epsilon$ turbulence model. The coupling between the phases is considered through momentum source terms and source terms in the k- and $\epsilon$-equations, which include the effect of wake-generated turbulence by means of consistent Lagrangian-like terms. Bubble motion is calculated by solving the equations of motion taking into account drag force, liquid inertia, added mass, buoyancy and gravity, and the transverse lift force. In order to identify the relative importance of the different physical phenomena involved in the model, the radial variation of the corresponding constitutive terms that appear in the transport equations of the liquid variables is analyzed in an instantaneous as well as in the time-averaged configuration. As a conclusion, the bubble source terms are directly responsible for the production of fluctuating kinetic energy and dissipation rate in the liquid, which means that their modelling determines the topology of the liquid flow in the bubble column. For validation the numerical results are quantitatively compared with detailed measurements utilizing phase-Doppler anemometry.},

abstract = {A comprehensive modeling method for algal growth in a photobioreactor is introduced. The model integrates fluid dynamics, mass transfer and the growth kinetics of algae. Availability of light, nutrients and carbon source as well as oxygen inhibition on growth is considered. The modeling approach has three-stages: (1) Detailed prediction of the flow field by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), (2) Division of the computational domain into larger compartments (blocks or zones), and (3) Compartmental modeling. Compartmentalization is performed because calculations with CFD would be very time consuming. Use of the compartmental model allows fast calculation of several concurrent phenomena while accuracy of the important flow parameters is retained. The approach uses a dynamic model called photosynthetic factory to model algal biomass growth. The combination of fluid dynamics and light distribution in the reactor model is important because the fluid dynamics defines the time-irradiance profile the algal cell experiences. Adequate mixing is therefore not only important for mass transfer but for light distribution as well. The movement of biomass in the column between light and dark areas allows for the continuation of growth even at high biomass concentrations, where light is only available on the sides of the reactor. The model is inherently capable of predicting this behavior from the fluid dynamics without the need to define time-irradiance profiles i.e. light-dark cycles. A comprehensive model such as this is needed for photobioreactor design and scale up, because the phenomena in the reactor are all interdependent. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamics conditions are supposed to affect light conversion in photobioreactors (PBRs), by modifying light availability of suspended photosynthetic cells. The present study aims at rigorously analyzing mixing conditions influence on PBR efficiency. Investigation is based on a Lagrangian formulation, which is well adapted to characterize individual cell history. Its association with a radiative-transfer model to characterize light availability is emphasized. Such approach has already been applied in PBR modeling, but with an over-simplified formulation where both cell trajectories and radiative transfer were solved independently. As energetic balances on the material and photonic phases will show, it is however necessary to introduce influence of the heterogeneous light access implied by non-ideal mixing conditions in the non-linear radiation field resolution. The proposed energetically consistent Lagrangian method will be finally associated to a standard photosynthetic growth model to simulate batch cultivation in a torus PBR, retained here as a practical example. Although hydrodynamics will be introduced in the calculation, simulations will show that, without a dynamic interaction between photosynthetic conversion and fluctuating light regimes implied by cell movement along light gradient (the so-called light/dark cycles effects), PBR efficiency for a given species is only dependent on the light input and reactor geometry, according to the first principle of thermodynamics. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Maximum photobioreactor (PBR) efficiency is a must in applications such as the obtention of microalgae-derived fuels. Improving PBR performance requires a better understanding of the "light regime" , the varying irradiance that microalgal cells moving in a dense culture are exposed to. We propose a definition of light regime that can be used consistently to describe the continuously varying light patterns in PBRs as well as in light/dark cycles. Equivalent continuous and light/dark regimes have been experimentally compared and the results show that continuous variations are not well represented by light/dark cycles, as had been widely accepted. It has been shown that a correct light regime allows obtaining photosynthetic rates higher than the corresponding to continuous light, the so-called "flashing light effect" and that this is possible in commercial PBRs. A correct PBR operation could result in photosynthetic efficiency close to the optimum eight quanta per O2. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It is well known that mixing caused by fluid turbulence can cause significantly increased growth rate of algae in photobioreactor flows under certain conditions. In general, flows in which the light penetrates into only a small fraction of the reactor flow field have the largest growth rate enhancement in the presence of fluid mixing. The current paper seeks to develop a computationally efficient prediction method for algae growth rate in practical photobioreactors using a combination of commercially available RANS turbulence models and a stochastic Lagrangian model for the turbulence fluctuations. The stochastic Lagrangian algae growth rate model is first validated by comparison with simulations of algae growth rate obtained by direct numerical simulation of homogeneous turbulence. We then demonstrate the stochastic Lagrangian model approach for prediction of algae growth rate in turbulent pipe flow, which is representative of the primary photoreaction component in many tubular algae production facilities. The results illustrate how algae growth rate increases as the pipe flow Reynolds number is increased. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A numerical simulation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was utilised to investigate the flow hydrodynamics of cylindrical bubble column type photobioreactors (PBRs) with a 30. l culture medium. To establish the reliability of the simulation study, the CFD model was validated using particle image velocimetry (PIV) computed data under various air flow rates. There were 32 simulation cases for the study comprising two PBR designs, four air flow rates and four nozzle size diameters. Hydrodynamic analyses such as {\%} volume of dead zones, average circulation time and turbulence intensity inside the simulated PBRs were evaluated. Results have shown that the most appropriate PBR for microalgae cultivation was a design with internal baffle and an extended cone-shaped bottom section. In addition, the recommended nozzle diameter was found to be 10mm and a minimum air flow rate of 0.10vvm. To eliminate dead zones inside the PBR, the flow rate can be slightly increased but should not exceed 0.15vvm. Practical evaluation through laboratory experiments has further confirmed the results of the study where the biomass concentration of Chlorella vulgaris from the proposed PBR was significantly higher compared to the standard PBR design. Based on the numerical investigation and practical evaluation, the improved PBR can be seen to be more effective in culturing microalgae particularly for larger scale mass production. {\textcopyright} 2014 IAgrE.},

abstract = {Microalgal growth and systemic productivity is not only affected by environmental conditions such as temperature, irradiance, and nutrient concentrations, but also by physical processes such as fluid flow and particulate sedimentation. Modeling and simulating the system is a cost-effective way to predict the growth behavior under various environmental and physical conditions while determining effective engineering approaches to maximize productivity. Many mathematical models have been proposed to describe microalgal growth, while computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been used to model the behavior of many fluid systems. Integrating the growth kinetics into a CFD model can help researchers understand the impact of a variety of parameters and determine what measures can be taken to overcome some obstacles in the aquaculture industry – self-shading, biomass sedimentation, and contamination – which prevent the production of high biomass yields. The aim of this study was to integrate physical and environmental effects to predict space- and time-dependent algal growth in industrial scale raceways. A commercial CFD software, ANSYS-Fluent 14.5, was used to solve the proposed models in regards to fluid flow, heat transfer, and nutrient balance. User-defined functions written in C language were used to incorporate the kinetic equations into a three-dimensional standard k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model of an open channel raceway system driven by a single paddlewheel. Simulated results were compared with light intensity, temperature, nutrient concentration, and algal biomass data acquired for 56 day from an industrial scale raceway pond constructed for the growth of Nannochloropsis salina and were observed to be in good agreement with one another. There was up to a 17.6{\%} increase in simulated productivity when the incoming CO2 concentration was increased from 0.0006 to 0.150 g L−1, while the effect of paddlewheel velocity was not significant. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model was particularly sensitive to the species-specific maximum growth rate, light attenuation coefficient, optimal growth temperature, half-saturation constant for growth based on irradiance, and death coefficient.

abstract = {Existing membrane fouling models are limited to simple hydraulic profiles which is a limitation particularly for planar membranes. Here, we present a new model that allows for a distributed shear profile, with dynamic linking of flux and transmembrane pressure (TMP). Shear profile is calculated using a multi-phase computational fluid dynamic approach, and is applied to a distributed parameter model to simulate membrane fouling profile and flux distribution. This allows for simulation of complex flux-step experiments, or situations where non-uniform shear is present. The model was applied to filtration experiments conducted in a pilot-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor treating slaughterhouse wastewater comprising 1950±250. mg/L total solids and was able to effectively fit experiments under dynamic critical flux conditions. Cake compressibility was a key parameter, and was estimated at 870±80. Pa. Non-uniform gas distribution decreased critical flux from 12. LMH to 8.5. LMH. This emphasises the importance of local flow conditions on membrane fouling behaviour and that performance can depend heavily on reactor configuration and hydraulics. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This review describes the structures of the two major integral membrane pigment complexes, the RC-LH1 'core' and LH2 complexes, which together make up the light-harvesting system present in typical purple photosynthetic bacteria. The antenna complexes serve to absorb incident solar radiation and to transfer it to the reaction centres, where it is used to 'power' the photosynthetic redox reaction and ultimately leads to the synthesis of ATP. Our current understanding of the biosynthesis and assembly of the LH and RC complexes is described, with special emphasis on the roles of the newly described bacteriophytochromes. Using both the structural information and that obtained from a wide variety of biophysical techniques, the details of each of the different energy-transfer reactions that occur, between the absorption of a photon and the charge separation in the RC, are described. Special emphasis is given to show how the use of single-molecule spectroscopy has provided a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the energy-transfer processes. We have tried, with the help of an Appendix, to make the details of the quantum mechanics that are required to appreciate these molecular mechanisms, accessible to mathematically illiterate biologists. The elegance of the purple bacterial light-harvesting system lies in the way in which it has cleverly exploited quantum mechanics.},

This study is conducted with Scenedesmus obliquus, a species known for its ability to assimilate a wide variety of carbon sources. Autotrophic experiments are first conducted to obtain the typical behavior (growth curve and nutrient consumption rates) of the alga in standard medium composition. Mixotrophic experiments then follow: aside from productivity aspects, results show that bacterial contaminations can remain an issue at this scale, even for closed systems such as photobioreactors. It is however shown possible to exploit some intrinsic dynamic properties of the algae to limit bacterial growth, with no significant impact on algal growth and biomass productivity. Anionic analyses on the mixotrophic cultures show that particular attention should be drawn on the phosphate and sulfate ions for further process optimization.},

Results showed that the average absorption rates in the culture irradiated with blue LEDs were higher than that irradiated with red LEDs. However, the radiation emitted by red LEDs rendered greater energy efficiency for biomass production compared to that emitted by blue LEDs. The development of a computational model based on a Monte Carlo method allowed the determination of the local volumetric rate of photon absorption at each point inside the PBR at different culture times. The information obtained with this tool allowed a detailed assessment of the effect of different radiation conditions on growth of microalgae, regardless of the PBR and the light source used.},

This study analyses the interplay between solar energy input, ambient temperature and system surface area to volume (SA:V) ratio in terms of photosynthetic performance (yield, areal and volumetric productivity, photon conversion efficiency). Ten pilot scale trials were conducted under subtropical conditions using 2 microalgae strains (Chlorella sorokiniana and Chlorella sp.) in 5 different cultivation system geometries: HRPs, flat panel PBRs (0.75m and 1.5m high) and tubular PBRs (0.74m and 1.49m high). The evaluation of culture temperature and biomass productivity response to solar irradiance in the five production systems suggests that the optimal SA:V ratio range lies between 43–73m2m−3 for C. sorokiniana in non-cooled systems regardless of system geometry under the conditions tested. The overall photosynthetic performance at higher SA:V ratios was improved for Chlorella sp. using temperature regulation. The highest observed daily photon conversion efficiency (PCE) was 4.44{\%} (based on illuminated PBR surface area and total solar spectrum) in the high flat panel PBR using C. sorokiniana (40.8gm−2d−1, 0.23gL−1d−1). The highest achieved mean PCE (based on illuminated PBR surface area and total solar spectrum) was 2.5{\%} in the low tubular PBR with Chlorella sp. (24.9gm−2d−1, 0.43gL−1d−1). The trial data provides important design principles to help fast track systems optimisation for near optimal sub-tropical conditions.},

abstract = {Several flow processes influence overall dynamics of gas-liquid flow and hence mixing and transport processes in bubble columns. In the present work, we have experimentally as well as computationally studied the effect of gas velocity, sparger design and coalescence suppressing additives on dynamics of gas-liquid flow in a rectangular bubble column. Wall pressure fluctuations were measured to characterize the low frequency oscillations of the meandering bubble plume. Bubble size distribution measurements were carried out using high-speed digital camera. Dispersed gas-liquid flow in bubble column was modelled using Eulerian-Eulerian approach. Bubble population was represented in the model with a single group or multiple groups. Bubble coalescence and break-up processes were included in the multi-group simulations via a suitable population balance framework. Effect of superficial gas velocity and sparger configurations was studied using single-group simulations. Model predictions were verified by comparison with the experimental data. Role of bubble size in determining plume oscillation period was studied. Multi-group simulations were carried out to examine evolution of bubble size distribution. An attempt is made to understand the relationship between local and global (over all the dispersion volume) bubble size distribution. The models and results reported here would be useful to develop and to extend the applications of multi-group CFD models. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Gupta2015,
abstract = {Microalgae cultivation has gained much interest in terms of the production of foods, biofuels, and bioactive compounds and offers a great potential option for cleaning the environment through CO2 sequestration and wastewater treatment. Although open pond cultivation is most affordable option, there tends to be insufficient control on growth conditions and the risk of contamination. In contrast, while providing minimal risk of contamination, closed photobioreactors offer better control on culture conditions, such as: CO2 supply, water supply, optimal temperatures, efficient exposure to light, culture density, pH levels, and mixing rates. For a large scale production of biomass, efficient photobioreactors are required. This review paper describes general design considerations pertaining to photobioreactor systems, in order to cultivate microalgae for biomass production. It also discusses the current challenges in designing of photobioreactors for the production of low-cost biomass.},

@article{Almohammed2014,
abstract = {In this work, different modeling approaches are used to study the hydrodynamics of gas-solid flows in a three-dimensional, lab-scale spouted fluidized bed. In particular, the simulation results obtained by the two-fluid model are compared with those of coupled CFD/DEM simulations. To explore the effects of the gas mass flow rate on the ability of the used simulation techniques to predict the flow behavior in the simulated test case, two different fluidization conditions are considered while maintaining the same computational set-up. The spouted fluidized bed has been evaluated by means of high-speed imaging for validating the simulation results. A comparative study of the two modeling approaches with experimental observations for bubble size in terms of the representative bubble diameter and the bed height has been carried out under both operating conditions. To identify significant simulation settings for the two-fluid model, a parameter study is carried out. The investigated input parameters include the gas-particle drag models, the granular temperature approach, the solid-phase wall boundary conditions in terms of specularity coefficient and the particle-particle restitution coefficient. At a gas mass flow rate of 0.005. kg/s, the predicted characteristics of the bubble formation and the bed expansion using both techniques are in very good agreement with experimental observations. Using the same validated settings, the two-fluid model shows some notable discrepancies when the gas mass flow rate is increased to 0.006. kg/s, while the DEM is more successful than the two-fluid model in reproducing realistic flow patterns. Although both techniques predict the right fluidization regimes and trends in bubble sizes and bed expansion, their results deviate significantly from the experimental data during the final stage of the bubble formation. The most important reasons for the differences in predicting the bed dynamics along with the advantages and limitations of the two approaches are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The diffusion-reaction equations and cellular automata (CA) rule along with the previously obtained growth kinetics parameters of PSB are used to simulate the coupled mass transport and biochemical reaction as well as the biomass growth. With this model, the effects of the illumination intensity, pH value and initial inoculation on the formed biofilm morphology, porosity, roughness and thickness are investigated. Numerical results show that the biofilm porosity and thickness continuously decreases and increases during the PSB biofilm formation process, respectively, while the surface roughness reaches a stable value after a certain time.

With this model, the effects of illumination intensity, pH value and initial inoculation on the biofilm morphology, active cell biomass as well as some characteristic parameters such as porosity, roughness and thickness is investigated. Numerical results show that cell inactivation occurs within the biofilm and the biofilm morphology varies with the operating conditions. Moreover, the roughness and thickness increase, but the porosity decreases as the biofilm grows. The amount of active cells is increasing with time.
