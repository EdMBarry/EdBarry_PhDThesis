Estimates of culture growth efficiency were derived from bioenergetic properties of cell metabolism. An equation system describing joint balance of flows of metabolite reductivity, high-energy protons (HEP) and high-energy bonds (HEB) was formulated. The maximum cell yield from light and the rate of energy expenditure for cell maintenance were found as mathematical expressions containing metabolic stoichiometric coefficients, rates of energy losses and intracellular matter turnover. Experimental study was conducted with a purple bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus grown continuously on hydrogen at different illumination intensities. The obtained numerical estimates of attainable maximum growth yield were compared with experimental data both taken from literature and obtained in this work. Theoretical and experimental yield values showed good agreement. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Wastewater recycling has been and continues to be practiced all over the world for a variety of reasons including: increasing water availability, combating water shortages and drought, and supporting environmental and public health protection. Nowadays, one of the most interesting issues for wastewater recycling is the on-site treatment and reuse of grey water. During this study the efficiency of a compact Submerged Membrane Bioreactor (SMBR) system to treat real grey water in a single house in Crete, Greece, was examined. In the study, grey water was collected from a bathtub, shower and washing machine containing significant amounts of organic matter and pathogens. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal in the system was approximately 87\%. Total suspended solids (TSS) were reduced from 95mgL−1 in the influent to 8mgL−1 in the effluent. The efficiency of the system to reduce anionic surfactants was about 80\%. Fecal and total coliforms decreased significantly using the SMBR system due to rejection, by the membrane, used in the study. Overall, the SMBR treatment produces average effluent values that would satisfy international guidelines for indoor reuse applications such as toilet flushing.},

	abstract = {Fluoropolymer tube photoreactors employing external UV lamps to irradiate the fluid conveyed by semi-transparent tubes are currently used for water and wastewater applications based on their intrinsic simplicity in system assembly and claims that the hydrophobic characteristics of the tube material reduce fouling. Nonetheless, there is limited published information to date on the short and long term disinfection efficiency and the potential implications of these factors for operational costs.In this paper, empirical and numerical bioassay experiments on virus inactivation were conducted on a pilot-scale fluoropolymer tube photoreactor using MS2 and T1 bacteriophages to gain further insight into delivered dose. Simulated and observed MS2 and T1 reduction equivalent doses displayed good agreement with an error (relative to the observed RED) ranging from −13.7\% to +4.4\% for MS2 (average=−3.9\%) and from −5.6\% to +27.0\% for T1 (average=+4.6\%).The impact of the fluoropolymer UV absorption on disinfection was also assessed. Integrating sphere measurements revealed that absorption events occurring in the fluoropolymer tubes play a pivotal role in determining disinfection efficiency. At 253.7nm, the diffuse transmission of UV light was the dominant radiative transfer mechanism and a considerable proportion of incident photon flux (13.5\%) was absorbed by the fluoropolymer tube. As highlighted by the model sensitivity analysis, the fluoropolymer absorption coefficient was found to be the most important factor affecting bacteriophage inactivation.Although further research will be conducted to investigate potential efficiency enhancements attainable through shape optimization and internal UV reflectors, CFD predictions indicated that the current electrical efficiency of the investigated photoreactor (0.0190–0.0289kWhm−3MS2log−1) was considerably higher than conventional UV photoreactors (0.0044–0.0049kWhm−3MS2log−1) suggesting that fluoropolymer tube UV technologies may not be ideal for high-flow installations or energy sensitive applications.},

They enable calculation of a composite Young’s modulus that varies in the biofilm and evolves with deformation. The biofilm-material model makes it possible to introduce a modeling example, produced by the Unified Multi-Component Cellular Automaton model, into the general-purpose finite-element code ABAQUS. Compressive, tensile, and shear loads are imposed, and the way the biofilm mechanical properties evolve is assessed. Results show that the local values of Young’s modulus increase under compressive loading, since compression results in the voids “closing,” thus making the material stiffer. For the opposite reason, biofilm stiffness decreases when tensile loads are imposed. Furthermore, the biofilm is more compliant in shear than in compression or tension due to the how the elastic shear modulus relates to Young’s modulus.},

	abstract = {Can Australia’s Ph.D. graduates be better utilised in the non-academic workforce? There has been a historic structural decline in the ability of Ph.D. graduates to find work within academia for the last couple of decades (Forsyth in A history of the modern Australian University, New South Press, Sydney, 2014). Around 60\% of Ph.D. graduates in Australia, now find jobs outside the academy, and the number is growing year on year (McGagh et al. in Securing Australia’s future: review of Australia’s research training system, https://acola.org.au/wp/PDF/SAF13/SAF13\%20RTS\%20report.pdf, 2016). The Ph.D. is a degree designed in the early twentieth century to credential the academic workforce. How to make it fit contemporary needs, when many, if not most, graduates do not work in academia, is a question that must be addressed by higher education managers and policymakers. Progress has been slow, partly because of the lack of reliable data-driven evidence to inform this work. This paper puts forward a novel hybrid quantitative/qualitative approach to the problem of analysing Ph.D. employability. We report on a project using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing to perform a ‘big data’ analysis on the text content of non-academic job advertisements. This paper discusses the use of ML in this context and its future utility for researchers. Using these methods, we performed an analysis of the extent of demand for Ph.D. student skills and capabilities in the Australian employment market. We show how these new methods allow us to handle large, complex datasets, which are often left unexplored because of human labour costs. This analysis could be reproduced outside of the Australian context, given an equivalent dataset. We give an outline of our approach and discuss some of the advantages and limitations. This paper will be of interest for those involved in reshaping Ph.D. programs and anyone interested in exploring new ML methods to inform education policy work.},

Light-dark cycle is important for photosynthetic microorganisms, but its impact on PSB wastewater treatment is still unclear. This study evaluated the effects of four light-dark cycles on PSB biomass, valuable substances production, and pollutant removal. Results indicate that the highest biomass concentration was obtained under 24 h light/24 h dark cycle. The highest concentrations of protein and coenzyme Q10 were obtained under 3 h light/3h dark cycle (826.73 and 88.8 mg/g, respectively). Pigment production were stable under all light-dark cycles tested. Light-dark cycles had little effect on COD and TP removal, while 24 h light/24 h dark cycle resulted in the highest NH3-N removal. ATP and RuBisCO concentrations followed similar trends under different light-dark cycles. These results revealed that PSB could provide more biomass and valuable substances with given energy by changing light-dark cycles.},

Benchmarking procedures are useful tools to assess the performance of these facilities and help identify best practices. To estimate the efficiency scores for each input involved in the operation of WWTPs, a non-radial data envelopment analysis model has been applied to a sample of Spanish WWTPs. The great advantage of this methodology is that it enables the identification of cost items on which to act to increase the efficiency at plant level. In the second stage, variables influencing efficiency scores have been identified. This analysis helps improve the understanding of how individual scores of efficiency and operating variables are related. It is shown that some factors do not affect all cost items—thus illustrating that an increase in global efficiency would not produce a reduction in all cost items. The benchmarking methodology and empirical application developed in this article could be very useful for improving the management of WWTPs and contribute to save operational costs.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.watres.2009.11.031},
	abstract = {Over recent decades, the environmental regulations on wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) have trended towards increasingly stringent nutrient removal requirements for the protection of local waterways. However, such regulations typically ignore other environmental impacts that might accompany apparent improvements to the WWTP. This paper quantitatively defines the life cycle inventory of resources consumed and emissions produced in ten different wastewater treatment scenarios (covering six process configurations and nine treatment standards). The inventory results indicate that infrastructure resources, operational energy, direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and chemical consumption generally increase with increasing nitrogen removal, especially at discharge standards of total nitrogen \&lt;5 mgN L -1 . Similarly, infrastructure resources and chemical consumption increase sharply with increasing phosphorus removal, but operational energy and direct GHG emissions are largely unaffected. These trends represent a trade-off of negative environmental impacts against improved local receiving water quality. However, increased phosphorus removal in WWTPs also represents an opportunity for increased resource recovery and reuse via biosolids applied to agricultural land. This study highlights that where biosolids displace synthetic fertilisers, a negative environmental trade-off may also occur by increasing the heavy metals discharged to soil. Proper analysis of these positive and negative environmental trade-offs requires further life cycle impact assessment and an inherently subjective weighting of competing environmental costs and benefits. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a technique to quantify the impacts associated with a product, service or process from cradle-to-grave perspective. Within the field of wastewater treatment (WWT) LCA was first applied in the 1990s. In the pursuit of more environmentally sustainable WWT, it is clear that LCA is a valuable tool to elucidate the broader environmental impacts of design and operation decisions. With growing interest from utilities, practitioners, and researchers in the use of LCA in WWT systems, it is important to make a review of what has been achieved and describe the challenges for the forthcoming years. This work presents a comprehensive review of 45 papers dealing with WWT and LCA. The analysis of the papers showed that within the constraints of the ISO standards, there is variability in the definition of the functional unit and the system boundaries, the selection of the impact assessment methodology and the procedure followed for interpreting the results. The need for stricter adherence to ISO methodological standards to ensure quality and transparency is made clear and emerging challenges for LCA applications in WWT are discussed, including: a paradigm shift from pollutant removal to resource recovery, the adaptation of LCA methodologies to new target compounds, the development of regional factors, the improvement of the data quality and the reduction of uncertainty. Finally, the need for better integration and communication with decision-makers is highlighted. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Within developing countries, wastewater treatment (WWT) has improved in recent years but remains a high priority sustainability challenge. Accordingly, life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have recently started to analyse the environmental impacts of WWT technologies on the specific context of less developed countries, mainly in China and India. This work presents a comprehensive review of this knowledge with the aim of critically analysing the main conclusions, gaps and challenges for future WWT-related LCAs in developing countries. The most commonly assessed technologies in the 43 reviewed articles are different variations of activated sludge and extensive treatments applied in decentralized systems; however, studies focused on advanced technologies or new sources of pollution (e.g. micropollutants) are still lacking. Goal and system boundaries are normally clearly defined, but significant stages for some technologies such as the construction and sludge management are frequently not included and functional units should be defined accordingly to specific conditions in developing countries. At the inventory level, a more concise description of sources and technical parameters would greatly improve the quality of the LCAs along with accountability of direct greenhouse gas emissions. Eutrophication and global warming are the two most commonly assessed impacts; however, the calculation of terrestrial ecotoxicity when the sludge is used for agricultural purposes, of water use and of the land use change impacts associated to extensive technologies should be encouraged. The estimation of more site-specific databases, characterization factors (especially for eutrophication) or normalization and weighting values combined with more affordable access to background databases and LCA software, would deeply increase the accuracy of WWT-related LCAs in developing countries. An increased usage of the uncertainty analysis should be encouraged to assess the influence of these gaps in the final interpretation of the results. The review finishes with a summary of the main challenges and research gaps identified and with specific guidelines for future researchers to avoid the most common shortcomings found in the reviewed studies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Much attention has been focused on two new approaches in the past years, (i) microbial fuel cells and (ii) microbial electrolysis cells, which directly generate electrical current or chemical products, respectively, during wastewater treatment. These systems are commonly denominated as bioelectrochemical systems, and a multitude of claims have been made in the past regarding the environmental impact of these treatment options. However, an in-depth study backing these claims has not been performed. Here, we have conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare the environmental impact of three industrial wastewater treatment options, (i) anaerobic treatment with biogas generation, (ii) a microbial fuel cell treatment, with direct electricity generation, and (iii) a microbial electrolysis cell, with hydrogen peroxide production. Our analysis showed that a microbial fuel cell does not provide a significant environmental benefit relative to the conventional anaerobic treatment option. However, a microbial electrolysis cell provides significant environmental benefits through the displacement of chemical production by conventional means. Provided that the target conversion level of 1000 A·m-3 can be met, the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and other environmentally harmful emissions (e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons) of the microbial electrolysis cell will be a key driver for the development of an industrial standard for this technology. Evidently, this assessment is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions, such as the used reactor materials and target performance. This provides a challenge and an opportunity for researchers in the field to select and develop appropriate and environmentally benign materials of construction, as well as demonstrate the required 1000 A·m-3 performance at pilot and full scale. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Over recent decades, the environmental regulations on wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) have trended towards increasingly stringent nutrient removal requirements for the protection of local waterways. However, such regulations typically ignore other environmental impacts that might accompany apparent improvements to the WWTP. This paper quantitatively defines the life cycle inventory of resources consumed and emissions produced in ten different wastewater treatment scenarios (covering six process configurations and nine treatment standards). The inventory results indicate that infrastructure resources, operational energy, direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and chemical consumption generally increase with increasing nitrogen removal, especially at discharge standards of total nitrogen \&lt;5 mgN L -1 . Similarly, infrastructure resources and chemical consumption increase sharply with increasing phosphorus removal, but operational energy and direct GHG emissions are largely unaffected. These trends represent a trade-off of negative environmental impacts against improved local receiving water quality. However, increased phosphorus removal in WWTPs also represents an opportunity for increased resource recovery and reuse via biosolids applied to agricultural land. This study highlights that where biosolids displace synthetic fertilisers, a negative environmental trade-off may also occur by increasing the heavy metals discharged to soil. Proper analysis of these positive and negative environmental trade-offs requires further life cycle impact assessment and an inherently subjective weighting of competing environmental costs and benefits. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a technique to quantify the impacts associated with a product, service or process from cradle-to-grave perspective. Within the field of wastewater treatment (WWT) LCA was first applied in the 1990s. In the pursuit of more environmentally sustainable WWT, it is clear that LCA is a valuable tool to elucidate the broader environmental impacts of design and operation decisions. With growing interest from utilities, practitioners, and researchers in the use of LCA in WWT systems, it is important to make a review of what has been achieved and describe the challenges for the forthcoming years. This work presents a comprehensive review of 45 papers dealing with WWT and LCA. The analysis of the papers showed that within the constraints of the ISO standards, there is variability in the definition of the functional unit and the system boundaries, the selection of the impact assessment methodology and the procedure followed for interpreting the results. The need for stricter adherence to ISO methodological standards to ensure quality and transparency is made clear and emerging challenges for LCA applications in WWT are discussed, including: a paradigm shift from pollutant removal to resource recovery, the adaptation of LCA methodologies to new target compounds, the development of regional factors, the improvement of the data quality and the reduction of uncertainty. Finally, the need for better integration and communication with decision-makers is highlighted. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an appropriate methodology for assessing the sustainability of a wastewater treatment plant design. The present study used a LCA approach for comparing alternative wastewater treatment processes for small and decentralised rural communities. The assessment was focused on two energy-saving systems (constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration) and a conventional one (activated sludge process). The low environmental impact of the energy-saving wastewater treatment plants was demonstrated, the most relevant being the global warming indicator. Options for reduction of life cycle impacts were assessed including materials used in construction and operational lifetime of the systems. A 10\% extension of operation lifetime of constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration systems led to a 1\% decrease in CO2 emissions, in both systems. The decrease in the abiotic depletion was 5 and 7\%, respectively. Also, replacing steel with HDPE in the activated sludge tank resulted in a 1\% reduction in CO2 emission and 1\% in the abiotic depletion indicator. In the case of the Imhoff tank a 1\% reduction in CO2 emissions and 5\% in the abiotic depletion indicator were observed when concrete was replaced by HDPE.},

To this end, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out comparing a conventional wastewater treatment plant (i.e. activated sludge system) with two nature-based technologies (i.e. hybrid constructed wetland and high rate algal pond systems). Moreover, an economic evaluation was also addressed. All systems served a population equivalent of 1500 p.e. The functional unit was 1 m3 of water. System boundaries comprised input and output flows of material and energy resources for system construction and operation. The LCA was performed with the software SimaPro® 8, using the ReCiPe midpoint method. The results showed that the nature-based solutions were the most environmentally friendly alternatives, while the conventional wastewater treatment plant presented the worst results due to the high electricity and chemicals consumption. Specifically, the potential environmental impact of the conventional wastewater treatment plant was between 2 and 5 times higher than that generated by the nature-based systems depending on the impact category. Even though constructed wetland and high rate algal pond systems presented similar results in terms of environmental impact, the latter showed to be the less expensive alternative. Nevertheless, the constructed wetland system should be preferred when land occupation is of major concern, since it has a smaller footprint compared to the high rate algal pond alternative.},

	abstract = {A comparative analysis is presented of light-driven advanced oxidation processes in terms of environmental sustainability. Photochemical oxidation has proven a viable option for treating emerging and priority pollutants at laboratory scale. Nevertheless, as a nascent technology, photocatalysis is yet to be widely applied at large-scale water treatment plants. This paper presents a powerful tool that should enable stakeholders to develop sustainable, large-scale, photocatalytic treatment plants by providing knowledge of environmental sustainability and hotspots (where technological flaws have high environmental impact) and understanding as to how process sustainability can be improved through scenario analyses. The following processes were examined: natural and simulated solar photolysis, solar photo-Fenton without hydrogen peroxide addition (solar/Fe), solar photo-Fenton (solar/Fe/H2O2), photolysis under UV-A irradiation (UV-A), titania-mediated photocatalysis (UV-A/TiO2), photolysis under UV-C irradiation (UV-C), and UV-C treatment with hydrogen peroxide addition (UV-C/H2O2). Actual life cycle inventory data were collected at bench scale, and the environmental performances estimated by means of life cycle assessment. Effective removal of 1 μg of 17α-ethynylestradiol per liter of wastewater, a commonly occurring micropollutant and endocrine disrupting chemical, was used as the functional unit. Solar photolysis exhibited an environmental footprint about 23 times higher than solar/Fe. Solar/Fe/H2O2 minimized the environmental footprint. Being energy intensive, simulated solar irradiation had a much higher (∼5-fold) environmental footprint than natural solar light. UV photolysis exhibited low environmental impact, with UV-C found to be about 3 times more environmentally friendly than UV-A photolysis. Addition of TiO2 to UV-A and H2O2 to UV-C caused their total environmental impacts to decrease by about 97\% and 88\%, implying that UV-A/TiO2 was better than UV-C/H2O2. In terms of total environmental footprint, the advanced oxidation processes descend in the following order: solar photolysis {\textgreater} UV-A {\textgreater} UV-C {\textgreater} solar/Fe {\textgreater} UV-A/TiO2 {\textgreater} UV-C/H2O2 {\textgreater} solar/Fe/H2O2. The environmental sustainability of all processes was directly proportional to treatment efficiency but inversely proportional to treatment time (due to the large energy input per unit time). Although reagent use (i.e. titania, iron, and hydrogen peroxide) was not associated with high environmental impact, its addition greatly improved process efficiency as well as environmental sustainability. For all examined light-driven processes, the main environmental hotspot was electricity consumption. Introduction of renewable energy sources could reduce the environmental footprint of oxidation processes by up to 87.5\%.},

	abstract = {Purpose Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have long-time environmental
impacts. The purpose of this paper is to assess the environmental
footprint of two advanced wastewater treatment (WWT) technologies in a
life cycle and sustainability perspective and identify the improvement
alternatives.
Design/methodology/approach In this study life cycle-based environmental
assessment of two advanced WWT technologies (moving bed biofilm reactor
(MBBR) and sequencing batch reactor (SBR)) has been carried out to
compare different technological options. Life cycle impacts were
computed using GaBi software employing the CML 2 (2010) methodology.
Primary data were collected and analysed through surveys and on-site
visits to WWTPs. The present study attempts to achieve significantly
transparent results using life cycle assessment (LCA) in limited
availability of data.
Findings The results of both direct measurements in the studied
wastewater systems and the LCA support the fact that advanced treatment
has the best environmental performance. The results show that the
operation phase contributes to nearly 99 per cent for the impacts of the
plant. The study identified emissions associated with electricity
production required to operate the WWTPs, chemical usage, emissions to
water from treated effluent and heavy metal emissions from waste sludge
applied to land are the major contributors for overall environmental
impacts. SBR is found to be the best option for WWT as compared to MBBR
in the urban context. In order to improve the overall environmental
performance, the wastewater recovery, that is, reusable water should be
improved. Further, sludge utilisation for energy recovery should be
considered. The results of the study show that the avoided impacts of
energy recovery can be even greater than direct impacts of greenhouse
gas emissions from the wastewater system. Therefore, measures which
combine reusing wastewater with energy generation should be preferred.
The study highlights the major shortcoming, i.e., the lack of national
life cycle inventories and databases in India limiting the wide
application of LCA in the context of environmental decision making.
Research limitations/implications The results of this study express only
the environmental impacts of the operation phase of WWT system and
sludge management options. Therefore, it is recommended that further
LCAs studies should be carried out to investigate construction and
demolition phase and also there is need to reconsider the toxicological-
and pathogen-related impact categories. The results obtained through
this type of LCA studies can be used in the decision-making framework
for selection of appropriate WWT technology by considering LCA results
as one of the attributes.
Practical implications The results of LCA modelling show that though the
environmental impacts associated with advanced technologies are high,
these technologies produce the good reusable quality of effluent. In
areas where water is scarce, governments should promote reusing
wastewater by providing additional treatment under safe conditions as
much as possible with advanced WWT. The LCA model for WWT and management
planning can be used for the environmental assessment of WWT
technologies.
Originality/value The current work provides a site-specific data on
sustainable WWT and management. The study contributes to the development
of the regional reference input data for LCA (inventory development) in
the domain of wastewater management.},

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been increasingly used in the field of wastewater treatment where the focus has been to identify environmental trade-offs of current technologies. In a novel approach, we use LCA to support early stage research and development of a biochemical system for wastewater resource recovery. The freshwater and nutrient content of wastewater are recognized as potential valuable resources that can be recovered for beneficial reuse. Both recovery and reuse are intended to address existing environmental concerns, for example, water scarcity and use of non-renewable phosphorus. However, the resource recovery may come at the cost of unintended environmental impacts. One promising recovery system, referred to as TRENS, consists of an enhanced biological phosphorus removal and recovery system (EBP2R) connected to a photobioreactor. Based on a simulation of a full-scale nutrient and water recovery system in its potential operating environment, we assess the potential environmental impacts of such a system using the EASETECH model. In the simulation, recovered water and nutrients are used in scenarios of agricultural irrigation-fertilization and aquifer recharge. In these scenarios, TRENS reduces global warming up to 15\% and marine eutrophication impacts up to 9\% compared to conventional treatment. This is due to the recovery and reuse of nutrient resources, primarily nitrogen. The key environmental concerns obtained through the LCA are linked to increased human toxicity impacts from the chosen end use of wastewater recovery products. The toxicity impacts are from both heavy metals release associated with land application of recovered nutrients and production of AlCl3, which is required for advanced wastewater treatment prior to aquifer recharge. Perturbation analysis of the LCA pinpointed nutrient substitution and heavy metals content of algae biofertilizer as critical areas for further research if the performance of nutrient recovery systems such as TRENS is to be better characterized. Our study provides valuable feedback to the TRENS developers and identifies the importance of system expansion to include impacts outside the immediate nutrient recovery system itself. The study also show for the first time the successful evaluation of urban-to-agricultural water systems in EASETECH.},

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a technique to quantify the impacts associated with a product, service or process from cradle-to-grave perspective. Within the field of wastewater treatment (WWT) LCA was first applied in the 1990s. In the pursuit of more environmentally sustainable WWT, it is clear that LCA is a valuable tool to elucidate the broader environmental impacts of design and operation decisions. With growing interest from utilities, practitioners, and researchers in the use of LCA in WWT systems, it is important to make a review of what has been achieved and describe the challenges for the forthcoming years. This work presents a comprehensive review of 45 papers dealing with WWT and LCA. The analysis of the papers showed that within the constraints of the ISO standards, there is variability in the definition of the functional unit and the system boundaries, the selection of the impact assessment methodology and the procedure followed for interpreting the results. The need for stricter adherence to ISO methodological standards to ensure quality and transparency is made clear and emerging challenges for LCA applications in WWT are discussed, including: a paradigm shift from pollutant removal to resource recovery, the adaptation of LCA methodologies to new target compounds, the development of regional factors, the improvement of the data quality and the reduction of uncertainty. Finally, the need for better integration and communication with decision-makers is highlighted. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, the wastewater treatment sector has undergone a shift to adapt to increasing discharge limits. In addressing the evaluation of innovative technologies, it is necessary to determine the scale at which reliable and representative values of environmental impacts and costs can be obtained, ensuring that the system under assessment follows the direction of eco-efficiency. This study has evaluated the environmental and economic indicators of an autotrophic nitrogen removal technology (ELAN®) from laboratory conception (1.5 L) to full scale (2 units of 115 m3) using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Indirect emissions related to electricity consumption are the main contributor in all impact categories except eutrophication. Electricity consumption referred to the functional unit (1 m3 of treated wastewater) decreases as the scale increases. The rationale behind this can be explained, among other reasons, by the low energy efficiency of small-scale equipment (pumps and aerators). Accordingly, a value of approximately 25 kg CO2eq per m3 of treated water is determined for laboratory scale, compared to only 5 kg CO2eq per m3 at full-scale. When it comes to assessing the reliability of data, a pilot scale system of 0.2 m3 allowed to perform a trustworthy estimation of environmental indicators, which were validated at full-scale. In terms of operational costs, the scale of approximately 1 m3 provided a more accurate estimate of the costs associated with energy consumption.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the potential environmental impacts associated with high rate algal ponds (HRAP) systems for wastewater treatment and resource recovery in small communities. To this aim, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out evaluating two alternatives: i) a HRAP system for wastewater treatment where microalgal biomass is valorized for energy recovery (biogas production); ii) a HRAP system for wastewater treatment where microalgal biomass is reused for nutrients recovery (biofertilizer production). Additionally, both alternatives were compared to a typical small-sized activated sludge system. An economic assessment was also performed. The results showed that HRAP system coupled with biogas production appeared to be more environmentally friendly than HRAP system coupled with biofertilizer production in the climate change, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, and fossil depletion impact categories. Different climatic conditions have strongly influenced the results obtained in the eutrophication and metal depletion impact categories. In fact, the HRAP system located where warm temperatures and high solar radiation are predominant (HRAP system coupled with biofertilizer production) showed lower impact in those categories. Additionally, the characteristics (e.g. nutrients and heavy metals concentration) of microalgal biomass recovered from wastewater appeared to be crucial when assessing the potential environmental impacts in the terrestrial acidification, particulate matter formation and toxicity impact categories. In terms of costs, HRAP systems seemed to be more economically feasible when combined with biofertilizer production instead of biogas. On the whole, implementing HRAPs instead of activated sludge systems might increase sustainability and cost-effectiveness of wastewater treatment in small communities, especially if implemented in warm climate regions and coupled with biofertilizer production.},

Wastewater treatment is no exception, with many currently used systems requiring large capital investment, land area and power consumption. High rate algal ponds offer a sustainable, efficient and lower cost option to the systems currently in use. They are shallow, mixed lagoon based systems, which aim to maximise wastewater treatment by creating optimal conditions for algal growth and oxygen production—the key processes which remove nitrogen and organic waste in HRAP systems. This design means they can treat wastewater to an acceptable quality within a fifth of time of other lagoon systems while using 50\% less surface area. This smaller land requirement decreases both the construction costs and evaporative water losses, making larger volumes of treated water available for beneficial reuse. They are ideal for rural, peri-urban and remote communities as they require minimum power and little on-site management. This review will address the history of and current trends in high rate algal pond development and application; a comparison of their performance with other systems when treating various wastewaters; and discuss their potential for production of added-value products. Finally, the review will consider areas requiring further research.},
