	%
%	\begin{itemize*}
%		\item	conception and design of the project;
%		\item	analysis and interpretation of the research data on which the publication is based;
%		\item	drafting significant parts of the publication or critically reviewing it so as to contribute to the interpretation.
%	\end{itemize*}
	
%	As an author, you must have participated sufficiently in the publication to take public responsibility for at least that part of the work that you contributed.

%	It may be useful to refer to specific parts of the methods, analyses, results, or discussion to illustrate your contribution to the paper.
